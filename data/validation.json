There is a notable difference between the eccentricities of the two rice varieties, with Cammeo rice grains having slightly higher eccentricity values.\n3. Cammeo rice grains also have a significantly larger convex area compared to Osmancik rice grains.\n4. Interestingly, the extent, which is a measure of the rice grain's compactness, is slightly higher for Osmancik rice grains compared to Cammeo rice grains.\n5. The correlation analysis between the numeric variables revealed some differences in the relationships between the variables for the two rice varieties.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Given the significant differences in size, shape, and extent measurements between the two rice varieties, it would be beneficial to study the factors that cause these differences, such as environmental conditions, agricultural practices, or genetic factors.\n2. Further research could focus on understanding how these differences in size, shape, and compactness might impact the properties of the rice in terms of cooking and nutritional qualities.\n3. Investigate the differences in taste, texture, and consumer preferences for the Cammeo and Osmancik rice varieties, given their morphological differences.\n4. An additional study could be conducted to understand the implications of these differences in the rice grains' morphology on crop yield, harvesting, and processing efficiency.\n5. The correlation analysis results could be used as a starting point to explore complex interactions between the variables related to the rice grain's morphology, which may help to better understand the underlying causes of the observed differences between the two varieties."

Numeric features such as Area, Perimeter, Major_Axis_Length, Minor_Axis_Length, Eccentricity, Convex_Area, and Extent are provided.\n3. Strong correlations exist between Area, Perimeter, Major_Axis_Length, Minor_Axis_Length, and Convex_Area. Eccentricity has a relatively lower correlation with these features.\n4. The average Area, Perimeter, Major_Axis_Length, Minor_Axis_Length, and Convex_Area are larger for Cammeo rice compared to Osmancik. Eccentricity is higher for Cammeo, while Extent is higher for Osmancik.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Although we have analyzed the dataset extensively based on its available features, none of these features directly measure nutrition content or quality.\n2. To make a nutrition-based recommendation, more information is needed, such as the macronutrient compositions (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), the micronutrient levels (vitamins and minerals), and the presence of other beneficial substances (phytochemicals, antioxidants, etc.).\n3. In the absence of nutrition-related information, it is not possible to make a definitive recommendation solely based on the given dataset.\n4. Further research or obtaining additional datasets with nutritional information would be suggested to make an informed decision on the most nutritious rice variety."

Cammeo rice has a larger average convex area as compared to Osmancik, indicating higher consistency in shape and potentially higher quality.\n3. The major axis length (length of the rice grains) is longer on average in Cammeo rice compared to Osmancik rice, suggesting a better texture when cooked.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Based on our analysis, you should consider using Cammeo rice for your recipes, as it has larger grains, better uniformity, and potentially better texture when cooked.\n2. Conduct taste tests with both varieties of rice to validate the findings from the data analysis and to ensure that your customers will prefer the chosen rice variety.\n3. Since the data does not conclusively tell us which variety has the best taste, it is important to consider other factors such as the type of dishes you prepare, the cooking methods, and the preferences of your target customers before making a final decision."

Both Commeo and Osmancik rice varieties have differences in their Area, Perimeter, Major_Axis_Length, Minor_Axis_Length, Eccentricity, Convex_Area, and Extent features.\n2. Commeo rice has larger Area, Perimeter, Major_Axis_Length, Minor_Axis_Length, Eccentricity, and Convex_Area values on average compared to Osmancik rice.\n3. Commeo rice grains tend to have a slightly lower Extent than Osmancik rice grains.\n4. Correlations between features in the dataset show strong relationships between Area, Perimeter, Major_Axis_Length, and Convex_Area.\n5. The t-test results indicate that the differences in means for all numeric features between Commeo and Osmancik rice are statistically significant.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As a rice importer/exporter, consider targeting different market segments based on the distinct characteristics of Commeo and Osmancik rice varieties. For example, Commeo rice could target consumers who prefer larger grains, while Osmancik rice could cater to those who prefer smaller grains.\n2. To further understand consumer preferences, conduct surveys or interview potential customers to gain insight into which rice characteristics are more important in determining market demand and potential.\n3. Use the findings of this analysis to inform marketing and branding efforts for both varieties, as demonstrating the distinct characteristics of Commeo and Osmancik in product descriptions and advertising could attract customers looking for specific rice features.\n4. Monitor the market for any shifts in preference or demand for rice characteristics, which may inform future purchasing decisions for importing or exporting different varieties.\n5. To support future market analyses, consider expanding the dataset to include additional rice varieties and features, such as taste, texture, and cooking properties, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of customer preferences and market potential."

Cammeo rice grains are generally more elongated as they have a slightly higher eccentricity than Osmancik rice grains.\n3. For both rice varieties, there are strong correlations between area, perimeter, major axis length, and convex area. This indicates that larger rice grains tend to have larger perimeters, major axis lengths, and convex areas, similarly for smaller grains.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Farmers could choose to cultivate Cammeo rice if they want to yield larger grains with elongated shapes, or cultivate Osmancik rice if they want to yield smaller, less elongated grains.\n2. Agricultural officers should create guidelines focusing on specific rice grain characteristics according to the consumer's preference or market demand, depending on whether larger grains or smaller grains are preferred.\n3. Future research and cultivation practices could focus on selectively breeding rice varieties with desirable characteristics such as optimal area, perimeter, and major axis length according to market demand.\n4. Further investigation into the extent and eccentricity properties of rice grains could lead to the development of specialized rice varieties tailored for specific markets or consumer preferences. These new varieties could improve overall farming practices and rice grain quality."

Cammeo rice tends to have larger Area, Perimeter, Major Axis Length, Minor Axis Length, and Convex Area compared to Osmancik rice on average.\n3. The average Eccentricity for Cammeo rice is slightly higher, indicating they might be slightly more elongated than Osmancik rice.\n4. The Extent values are similar between Cammeo and Osmancik rice, indicating their shapes are not significantly different.\n5. The correlation between Major Axis Length and Minor Axis Length is low, which means that as one of these characteristics increases, the other does not necessarily increase or decrease. However, Major Axis Length has a moderate positive correlation with Area and Perimeter, while Minor Axis Length has a high positive correlation with Area.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Since Cammeo rice has larger Area, Perimeter, and Convex Area than Osmancik rice, consumers looking for bigger rice grains might prefer Cammeo.\n2. Consumers who desire rice with a specific shape or elongation might not find significant differences between the two rice varieties due to similar Extent values.\n3. For consumers who are more concerned about the length of the rice grains, the Cammeo variety has a higher average Major Axis Length than Osmancik, making it a better choice.\n4. Further analysis can be conducted to explore the dataset more deeply and understand potential differences in cooking qualities or taste preferences.\n5. Sharing these findings with the consumers can help them make more informed decisions when purchasing rice based on their grain size and shape preferences."

The average rating across all products in the dataset is 3.99, with a median rating of 4.00 and a standard deviation of 1.01, showing a relatively high overall satisfaction among customers.\n2. Montblanc, Aether Beauty, Four Sigmatic, and Fable & Mane are among the brands with the highest average ratings, indicating strong customer preferences toward their products.\n3. Cologne, Aftershave, and High Tech Tools are among the categories with the highest average ratings, suggesting customers are generally satisfied with these product types.\n4. There is a positive correlation between rating and number_of_reviews (0.08) as well as rating and love (0.09), indicating that higher-rated products tend to attract more reviews and appreciation from customers.\n5. The better-than-Sex Mascara from Too Faced is among the top 10 most-reviewed products, but its rating is just 3.5, which is relatively lower compared to the average.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. Develop targeted marketing strategies focusing on promoting top-rated brands (such as Montblanc, Aether Beauty, and Four Sigmatic) and categories (Cologne, Aftershave, High Tech Tools) to increase customer satisfaction and sales.\n2. Analyze the reasons behind the lower-rated products and categories. Conduct surveys or further research to understand customer's complaints and pain points, and identify areas where improvements can be made.\n3. Leverage customer reviews and \"love\" data to identify popular products or product trends that can be used to prioritize marketing efforts, optimize product curation, and tailor promotions to customer preferences.\n4. Investigate and address the reasons for high review counts but low ratings (e.g., the Too Faced Mascara). Collaborate with the brand to improve the product quality or consider replacing it with a better product if improvement is not possible.\n5. Continue monitoring and analyzing customer reviews and ratings on a regular basis to stay informed about changing preferences and adapt marketing strategies accordingly."

        "content": "## Final report\n### Findings\n1. The top categories in terms of user engagement (love and number of reviews) are Lipstick, Foundation, Eye Palettes, Face Serums, and Moisturizers.\n2. The top brands in terms of user engagement are SEPHORA COLLECTION, Anastasia Beverly Hills, tarte, FENTY BEAUTY by Rihanna, and Urban Decay.\n3. The correlation between average rating and number of reviews is quite low (0.08), indicating that a higher average rating does not necessarily lead to a higher number of reviews.\n4. Based on attributes such as online_only, exclusive, limited_edition, and limited_time_offer, there is no significant impact on user engagement for most attributes. However, the average engagement (love) for online-only products is lower than for those not exclusively online.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on promoting the top categories and brands identified above as they have higher user engagement. Consider featuring these products on the homepage and in marketing campaigns.\n2. Encourage users to leave reviews and ratings for products, and consider using incentives such as loyalty points or discounts for doing so. This will provide valuable feedback and help other users make informed decisions.\n3. Investigate the discrepancy between high ratings and low engagement for certain products. This could indicate niche products that have a small but loyal user base, or it could be an opportunity to introduce these well-rated products to a broader audience.\n4. Review the strategy for promoting online-only products. The lower engagement observed may indicate that users prefer to experience these products in person. Consider offering samples, testers, or other ways for users to try these products before committing to a purchase."

Top 3 categories with the highest number of reviews were Foundation, Mascara, and Moisturizers, while top 3 categories with the highest love counts were Lipstick, Foundation, and Eye Palettes.\n2. Among brands, Sephora Collection had the highest number of reviews as well as love counts, followed by different brands such as Anastasia Beverly Hills, tarte, and Too Faced in different positions.\n3. There is a weak positive correlation between product rating and both number_of_reviews (0.08) and love (0.09), meaning that higher-rated products may sell slightly better, but the relationship is not strong.\n4. There is a weak negative correlation between product price and number_of_reviews (-0.08) and a weak negative correlation between product price and love (-0.09); products with lower prices may have slightly better performance, but the relationship is not strong.\n5. In terms of exclusivity and limited-time aspects, exclusive products without limited edition or limited-time offer characteristics have a higher number of reviews and love counts, accounting for 25% of total reviews and 29% of total love.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on popular categories such as Foundation, Mascara, Moisturizers, Lipstick, and Eye Palettes to optimize the supply chain and ensure sufficient stock.\n2. Strengthen relationships with top-performing brands like Sephora Collection, Anastasia Beverly Hills, tarte, and Too Faced to secure a steady supply of products that customers love.\n3. Monitor product ratings and reviews closely to identify potential underperforming items, and consider adjusting product offerings accordingly.\n4. Consider offering more products at a lower price range, as a weak negative correlation exists between price and product performance (number_of_reviews and love). However, it is essential to maintain an attractive offering at all price points to cater to a diverse customer base.\n5. Focus on exclusive products without limited edition or limited-time offer characteristics as they have higher product performance in terms of number_of_reviews and love. Consider collaborating with popular brands to develop more exclusive products for Sephora."

The average rating for products is 3.99, with a minimum of 0.00 and a maximum of 5.00, indicating a fairly high satisfaction among customers.\n3. The top brands with the highest average ratings include Montblanc, Aether Beauty, Four Sigmatic, and Fable & Mane.\n4. The top brands with the highest total number of reviews include SEPHORA COLLECTION, Too Faced, and Urban Decay.\n5. The analysis shows that more expensive products do not necessarily have higher ratings on average.\n6. There are weak correlations between the numeric columns, so no strong linear relationships are observed among rating, number_of_reviews, love, and price.\n7. The top categories with the highest average ratings include Lid Shadow Brush, Cologne, and Aftershave.\n8. The top categories with the highest total number of reviews include Foundation, Mascara, and Moisturizers.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on promoting and investing in high-performing brands such as Montblanc, Aether Beauty, Four Sigmatic, and Fable & Mane, which have high average ratings.\n2. Continue to support popular brands like SEPHORA COLLECTION, Too Faced, and Urban Decay, as they have high total numbers of reviews, indicating strong customer engagement.\n3. Consider expanding or promoting the high-rating and popular categories, such as Lid Shadow Brush, Cologne, Aftershave, Foundation, Mascara, and Moisturizers, to attract more customers.\n4. Don't solely focus on more expensive products for revenue, as they don't necessarily guarantee higher ratings and customer satisfaction. A balance between quality and price may yield better results.\n5. Analyze customer feedback from reviews and identify areas of improvement for lower-performing brands or categories to boost their ratings and increase revenue.\n6. Monitor market trends in beauty and skincare to identify potential new products and categories for future investments."

Course certificates are offered in three types: course, specialization, and professional certificate.\n3. Beginner-level courses have higher average enrollments than intermediate, mixed, and advanced courses.\n4. Professional certificate courses have higher average enrollments than courses and specializations.\n5. Course ratings do not significantly vary across different difficulty levels and certificate types.\n6. Machine Learning (by Stanford University) and The Science of Well-Being (by Yale University) are two of the most popular courses with over 3 million and 2.5 million enrollments, respectively.\n7. Certificates like Python for Everybody (by University of Michigan) and AI For Everyone (by deeplearning.ai) show high enrollment numbers in the beginner category.\n8. In intermediate and advanced levels, courses related to data science, deep learning, and cloud computing (from organizations like Google Cloud and IBM) are popular.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate more resources for beginner-level courses, as they attract a higher number of enrollments.\n2. Consider offering more professional certificate courses, as they have higher average enrollments than courses and specializations.\n3. Maintain high-quality course content, as the course ratings are generally high across all difficulty levels and certificate types.\n4. Explore collaborations with popular course providers like Stanford University, Yale University, University of Michigan, and deeplearning.ai for creating new, high-quality courses.\n5. Develop more courses around trending topics, like data science, deep learning, cloud computing, and AI, especially in intermediate and advanced levels.\n6. Regularly analyze enrollment and satisfaction rates, and update course content or introduce new courses based on student feedback and industry trends."

Courses of \"Mixed\" difficulty have the highest average student enrollment (133,633 students) and are also highly-rated (average rating of 4.71).\n2. \"Beginner\" and \"Intermediate\" difficulty courses also have substantial average student enrollments (81,975 and 73,264 students, respectively) and high average ratings (4.68 and 4.65, respectively).\n3. The top 5 highest-rated courses have ratings between 4.9 and 5.0 and are offered by various organizations, such as Universidad Austral, Imperial College London, and Yale University.\n4. The top 5 most popular courses (highest student enrollment) are offered by well-known institutions, such as Stanford University, Yale University, and the University of Michigan.\n5. The organizations providing the highest-rated courses based on certificate type include ScrumTrek, London Business School, and Crece con Google.\n6. The organizations with the most students enrolled based on certificate type are the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and Yale University.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on offering \"Mixed\" difficulty courses as they are highly-rated and attract the most students.\n2. Consider offering courses from top institutions like Stanford University, Yale University, and the University of Michigan, as these courses have high ratings and attract a large number of students.\n3. Look into partnerships with organizations that provide both high-rated courses and high student enrollment, such as ScrumTrek, London Business School, and Crece con Google.\n4. Offer a mix of beginner and intermediate difficulty courses to cater to a wider range of students, given their substantial enrollment numbers and high ratings.\n5. Continuously monitor and evaluate courses, collaborating with top-performing organizations to provide high-quality courses that target a diverse audience."

The top course organizations attracting the highest number of students are University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, University of California, Irvine, and Johns Hopkins University.\n3. The majority of students are enrolled in individual courses (51,131,300 students), followed by specializations (27,262,200 students), and professional certificates (2,288,400 students).\n4. There is a weak positive correlation (0.07) between course ratings and the number of enrolled students, indicating that course quality (ratings) may not be the main factor driving student enrollments.\n5. Stanford University's mixed-difficulty courses have the highest average enrollments, and there are also high enrollment rates in mixed or beginner courses from universities like Yale, Georgia Institute of Technology, and University of Michigan.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To address workforce skill gaps, focus on providing beginner-level training programs, as they have the highest enrollment rates, reflecting more interest among students and professionals looking to learn new skills.\n2. Collaborate with top course organizations such as University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, and Stanford University, as they have a strong track record in attracting a large number of enrollees.\n3. Develop a mix of individual courses and specializations, as these formats are more popular among students than professional certificates.\n4. Although the correlation between course ratings and enrollments is weak, it is still important to maintain high-quality training programs since attracting a large number of enrollees is necessary, but not sufficient, for addressing workforce skill gaps. Employees who enroll in high-quality courses may be more motivated to complete their training and apply their newly acquired skills to their jobs.\n5. Consider offering more mixed-difficulty courses or combining beginner-level courses with intermediate and advanced courses, as this format seems to attract a larger number of enrollees. Additionally, partnering with universities that have high average enrollment rates for mixed and beginner courses (such as Stanford University, Yale University, and Georgia Institute of Technology) may further boost employee engagement in these training programs."

The league's top performers were Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United, Newcastle, and Liverpool, in terms of points earned during the season.\n2. Manchester City had the highest goal difference, scoring 94 goals and conceding 33.\n3. Arsenal had the second-highest goal difference, scoring 88 goals and conceding 43.\n4. There is a weak correlation between clubs' Market Value, Wage Bill, and their performance in terms of Points, Goals Scored, Goals Conceded, and Goal Difference.\n5. Brighton has the highest Spending Efficiency, with the ratio of points earned per million spent on Market Value and Wage Bill combined, followed by Arsenal and Brentford.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider investing in more cost-effective players and scouting systems to identify talent that can improve the team's overall performance without a significant increase in spending.\n2. Analyze the strategies and team structures of high-efficiency clubs like Brighton, Arsenal, and Brentford to understand how they achieve good results on a tighter budget.\n3. Reevaluate the current player wage structure to ensure that wages are in line with their contributions to the team's performance on the pitch.\n4. Continue monitoring the relationship between financial investments and on-field performance over multiple seasons to identify trends and make appropriate adjustments to the club's budget strategy.\n5. Investigate potential revenue streams and cost-saving measures to improve the club's financial performance and provide more flexibility in making future budget decisions."

Southampton finished at the top of the league table with 55 points, followed by Leicester with 49 points, Arsenal, Bournemouth, and Everton with 48 points each.\n2. Nottingham was at the bottom of the league table with 29 points, followed by Liverpool with 31 points, and Man United with 33 points.\n3. Arsenal and Brighton had the highest average home and away shots per match, with 18.63 and 18.47 home shots and 12.58 and 13.74 away shots respectively.\n4. Arsenal also had the highest average home and away shots on target per match, with 6.47 and 4.26 respectively.\n5. Nottingham had the highest average home fouls per match with 12.00, while Wolves had the highest average away fouls per match with 12.47.\n6. Arsenal and Brighton also had the highest average home and away corners per match, with 7.00 and 7.53 home corners and 4.74 away corners for both teams.\n7. Referee D Madley had the highest average yellow cards per match with 8.00, while Referee D Bond had the highest average red cards per match with 0.25.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. Based on the league table positions, consider sponsoring or advertising with the top performing teams like Southampton, Leicester, Arsenal, and Everton, as they may have higher viewership due to their success.\n2. Since Arsenal and Brighton have high average shots and corners, sponsoring or advertising during their matches may potentially result in more frequent brand exposure due to corner kicks or goal attempts.\n3. As a sponsor, consider partnering with teams with high discipline, such as teams with low average fouls or low average yellow and red cards. This will prevent the brand from being adversely affected by a negative association with team behavior.\n4. Advertise with popular referees like D Madley, as they might manage more high-profile matches, increasing the visibility and reach of the brand. However, consider balancing this decision with the potential impact of a higher number of yellow or red cards shown during matches.\n5. Keep monitoring performance metrics throughout the season, so that adjustments can be made in sponsorship or advertising decisions, as well as to identify opportunities to focus on specific segments or match-ups."

One-goal victories were the most common, followed by draws and two-goal victories.\n3. The top 5 highest-scoring games involved Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Fulham, Southampton, and Tottenham.\n4. Arsenal, Brighton, Newcastle, Manchester United, and Liverpool had the highest number of total shots, while Brighton, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham had the most shots on target.\n5. Nottingham, Wolves, and Tottenham were among the teams with the highest number of yellow cards, while Wolves, Crystal Palace, Leeds, and Leicester had the highest number of red cards.\n6. There is a strong positive correlation between points and goals scored, and a negative correlation between points and yellow/red cards.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize stocking merchandise for teams that had high-scoring games, such as Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Fulham, Southampton, and Tottenham, as fans may be more attracted to successful and entertaining clubs.\n2. Because teams with high yellow and red card counts tend to have lower points, consider stocking fewer items for clubs like Wolves, Crystal Palace, Leeds, and Leicester, which may have smaller fanbases due to their on-field disciplinary records.\n3. Focus on promoting merchandise for clubs with high shot and shot-on-target counts, such as Arsenal, Brighton, Newcastle, Manchester United, and Liverpool, as these teams are likely to be more popular among fans due to their attacking style of play.\n4. Monitor the performance of clubs throughout the season and adjust merchandise offerings accordingly, as fans might be more attracted to clubs that consistently perform well and exhibit exciting playstyles."

The most prevalent disaster types in the United States are Fire (especially in Texas), Severe Storms (mostly in Missouri and Kansas), and Hurricanes (predominantly in Texas, North Carolina, and Virginia).\n2. States with the highest overall frequency of natural disasters include Texas, Missouri, Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia.\n3. The disasters with the longest average duration are Fire, Fishing Losses, Earthquakes, and Other (unspecified) disasters.\n4. There is a strong correlation between declared disaster programs (IH, IA, PA, and HM) and disaster types, suggesting that certain programs are likely to be needed for specific types of disasters.\n5. The number of disasters per year has been increasing over time, with notable peaks in 2005, 2011, and recent years (2020 and 2021).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize investments and improvements in transportation infrastructure in the most disaster-prone states, focusing initially on Texas, Missouri, Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia.\n2. Consider targeting the most frequent disaster types when planning infrastructure improvements, such as strengthening infrastructure against Fire, Severe Storms, and Hurricanes.\n3. Allocate resources to declare disaster programs, especially IH, IA, PA, and HM programs, considering the strong correlation they have with disaster types. Adapt investments to the specific needs of each disaster type and its associated programs.\n4. Take into account the duration of each disaster type when planning investments and improvements, allocating more resources to areas affected by longer-lasting disaster types such as Fire, Fishing Losses, and Earthquakes.\n5. Given the increasing trend in the number of disasters per year, monitor and reassess the disaster situation on an ongoing basis to adjust the priorities and investments in transportation infrastructure accordingly."

The most common incident types are Severe Storm, Hurricane, and Flood.\n3. Texas, Missouri, and Virginia are the most affected states by the greatest number of disasters.\n4. The most common incident type in these top affected states is Severe Storm, followed by floods and hurricanes.\n5. The duration of incidents (period between the beginning and end of a disaster) varies depending on the type - the longest on average is Fire, whereas the shortest are Snowstorm and Tornado.\n6. The time it takes to close out a disaster (the period between the end of the disaster and official closeout) also varies by incident type. For instance, hurricanes and severe storms take a relatively longer time to close out, while droughts and snowstorms take a shorter time.\n7. There is a weak positive correlation (0.20) between the duration of disasters and the time it takes to close them out.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize providing resources and support to the most affected states, particularly Texas, Missouri, and Virginia.\n2. Focus on preparing for and mitigating the most common incident types: Severe Storm, Hurricane, and Flood.\n3. Implement regular reviews and updates of disaster management plans based on the changing frequencies and types of disasters.\n4. Increase investment in early warning systems and risk communication to ensure prompt response and community resilience to these common disasters.\n5. Encourage the development of local emergency response teams to reduce the duration of disasters and shorten the time to close them out.\n6. Develop support programs for the most affected communities in the top affected states to ensure that sufficient resources are available to cope with multiple disaster incidents.\n7. Foster collaboration between local, regional, and national health organizations to streamline emergency response and recovery efforts, and to promote the sharing of best practices in disaster mitigation strategies."

Severe Storms, Hurricanes, and Floods are the most common natural disasters in the United States, accounting for approximately 68% of all disaster declarations in the dataset.\n2. The top 5 most affected states by the number of disaster declarations are Texas, Missouri, Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia.\n3. The frequency of natural disasters appears to be increasing over time, with a notable increase from the late 1980s to the present day.\n4. The average durations of Fire and Fishing Losses-related disasters are the longest, followed by Earthquakes and other types of incidents.\n5. Among states, the Marshall Islands, North Dakota, and Texas have the longest average duration of disaster incidents.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate a significant portion of resources to address the most common natural disasters (Severe Storms, Hurricanes, and Floods).\n2. Prioritize resource allocation to the most affected states, focusing on Texas, Missouri, Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia, while also tracking other states that experience high average durations or rapidly increasing disaster frequencies.\n3. Monitor and adjust the resource allocation strategy to accommodate the increasing frequency of natural disasters in the country.\n4. Develop specific contingency plans and allocate specialized resources to deal with Fire, Fishing Losses, and Earthquake disasters, as they tend to have longer durations and may require extended support.\n5. Collaborate with local governments and other nonprofit organizations in the identified states to create a coordinated disaster response network and more effectively support affected communities."

The average number of disasters per year is 107.46, with the highest number of 740 disasters occurring in 2005, while the lowest happened in 1958 with only 1 disaster.\n3. The top 5 states with the highest number of disasters are Texas (8.42% of total disasters), Missouri (4.87%), Virginia (4.59%), Oklahoma (4.01%), and Georgia (3.40%).\n4. The average duration of disasters is highest for Fires (71.87 days), Fishing Losses (52.29 days), and Earthquakes (45.15 days). The shortest durations are for Snowstorms (4.29 days) and Typhoons (2.25 days).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize disaster preparedness strategies for Severe Storms, Hurricanes, and Floods as they are the most frequent disaster types.\n2. Allocate more resources and focus on disaster preparedness in states with higher occurrences of disasters, particularly Texas, Missouri, Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia.\n3. Develop specific disaster management plans based on the average duration of each disaster type. For instance, Fires and Fishing Losses should have long-term disaster response/recovery plans, while Snowstorms and Typhoons can have short-term response plans.\n4. Collaborate with experts in each disaster type to develop predictive models and early warning systems that can improve response time and overall preparedness."

EMS has the highest number of calls, followed by Traffic and Fire.\n3. The top 3 reasons for calls are vehicle accidents, disabled vehicles, and fire alarms.\n4. The busiest townships for emergency calls are Lower Merion, Abington, and Norristown.\n5. Call volume is generally higher during weekdays as compared to weekends.\n6. Call volume is highest in January, with a lower volume during the late summer and early fall months.\n7. The busiest hours for EMS calls are around noon, for Fire calls around 5 pm, and for Traffic calls around 4 pm.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate more resources to deal with EMS emergencies, as they have the highest call volume.\n2. Focus on the top reasons for calls (vehicle accidents, disabled vehicles, and fire alarms) when training and preparing the emergency response teams.\n3. Increase staff and resources in the busiest townships (Lower Merion, Abington, and Norristown) to improve emergency response times.\n4. During weekdays, ensure that there are enough resources available to handle the higher call volume.\n5. Adjust staffing patterns based on the time of day, with more resources available during peak hours for each emergency category.\n6. Plan for additional resources during the winter months to address the increased call volume.\n7. Regularly review the data to identify trends and areas for improvement, and adjust resource allocation accordingly."

Among the top 5 townships, POTTSTOWN and NORRISTOWN have higher percentages of EMS calls than the others, while LOWER MERION has a higher percentage of Traffic calls.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate more resources (personnel and equipment) for EMS-related emergencies, as they make up the majority of emergency calls.\n2. Ensure that equipment and personnel are prepared for the most frequent emergencies, particularly vehicle accidents, disabled vehicles, and fire alarms.\n3. Schedule extra staffing during peak hours between 11 am and 5 pm and on Fridays when call volume is highest.\n4. Pay special attention to resource allocation in the top 5 townships with the most emergency calls, considering higher EMS demand in POTTSTOWN and NORRISTOWN, as well as higher Traffic demand in LOWER MERION.\n5. Conduct periodic reviews of the emergency call data to ensure that staffing and resource allocation remains effective and adapts to any changes in patterns over time."

The top three reasons for emergency calls are related to vehicle accidents (1864 calls), disabled vehicles (580 calls), and fire alarms (551 calls).\n3. The number of emergency calls is highest during the day (between 10 AM and 6 PM) and drops during the night (after 11 PM).\n4. The highest number of emergency calls are received on Fridays, with a gradual decrease over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).\n5. The months with the highest numbers of calls are January, June, and July.\n6. The average response time is highest for EMS calls (294.7 minutes), followed by Fire (274.3 minutes) and Traffic (249.0 minutes).\n7. The response time is generally faster during mid-day and early evening hours, and slower during the early morning hours.\n8. The average response time is higher on Sundays and lower on weekdays, particularly on Fridays.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider reallocating available resources (such as personnel and vehicles) to be more focused on EMS and Traffic-related emergencies, as they make up the majority of calls.\n2. Provide additional training to first responders on handling the most common incident types, such as vehicle accidents and disabled vehicles.\n3. Increase the number of on-duty first responders during peak hours (10 AM to 6 PM) to reduce response times during high call volumes. Also, ensure adequate coverage during the night considering the slower response times.\n4. Evaluate the reasons for the higher emergency call volume on Fridays, and consider implementing specific measures or programs to address those issues.\n5. Assess the causes behind the longer average response times on Sundays, and identify potential solutions to improve response time during weekends.\n6. Continue monitoring the distribution of emergency calls and response times on an ongoing basis. Regularly update resource allocation, training, and operational policies to ensure the most efficient response to emergencies."

In the Traffic category, 65.11% of the calls are related to vehicle accidents.\n4. For the Fire category, 40.72% of the calls are fire alarms.\n5. Emergency calls distribution across days of the week shows that EMS and Fire categories have more calls during weekdays, with the highest proportion of calls on Wednesdays. Traffic-related calls also peak on Fridays.\n6. The distribution of emergency calls by hour shows that EMS and Fire calls are higher during daytime hours, while Traffic calls peak during late afternoon hours (around 4 PM to 6 PM).\n7. The distribution of emergency calls by month indicates a slightly higher volume of calls during January for EMS, Fire, and Traffic categories.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate more resources to handle EMS-related emergencies, as they represent the majority of call types.\n2. Schedule additional staff during weekdays, particularly on Wednesdays and Fridays, when call volumes are higher across all categories.\n3. Adjust staff shift timings to cover daytime hours (especially late afternoon) when call volumes peak for EMS, Fire, and Traffic emergencies.\n4. Prepare for potential increases in emergency calls during January by ensuring adequate resource allocation and staffing during this time.\n5. Ensure staff training and equipment are up-to-date for the most common types of emergencies (e.g., Fall Victim, Respiratory Emergency, Cardiac Emergency, and Vehicle Accidents)."

The average screen size is 6.47 inches, with a median of 6.50 inches, showing a relatively homogeneous distribution of screen sizes.\n4. The average battery capacity is 4676 mAh, with a median of 5000 mAh.\n5. The average storage capacity is 122.6 GB, with a median of 128 GB.\n6. The average RAM size is 5.91 GB, with a median of 6 GB.\n7. Camera specifications vary, with the primary camera having an average of 59.15 MP and the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary cameras having averages of 13.69 MP, 4.81 MP, and 3.23 MP, respectively.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on acquiring replacement parts for phones with screen sizes around 6.47 inches, as this is the average screen size observed in the dataset.\n2. Prioritize offering battery replacements for phones with battery capacities around 4676 to 5000 mAh, as this is the most commonly observed range.\n3. Stock up on replacement storage and RAM components around 128 GB and 6 GB, respectively, as these are the most common capacities found in the dataset.\n4. For camera repairs, pay special attention to the primary and secondary cameras, as their specifications have higher averages compared to the lesser used tertiary and quaternary cameras.\n5. As a lower-priced option for customers, consider offering repairs for phones priced around $399, which is the median price in the dataset.\n6. Pay close attention to phones from popular brands like Apple, Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Google, as they are well-represented in the dataset and likely to be more common among customers."

The age distribution shows that bullying affects students of all ages, with a higher prevalence in younger students.\n3. Both female and male students are affected by bullying, with slightly more reported cases among female students.\n4. Students who experienced bullying reported higher levels of physical attacks, physical fighting, and loneliness.\n5. Students who experienced bullying reported fewer close friends and higher likelihood of missing school without permission.\n6. There is a weak correlation between bullying and students' perception of their peers and parents, suggesting that perceptions of peers and parents might not be the primary contributing factors to bullying.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Establish or strengthen anti-bullying initiatives in the school, focusing on both on school property and off school property, as well as cyberbullying.\n2. Educate students, teachers, and parents about the signs and consequences of bullying and encourage them to report such incidents.\n3. Implement support programs focusing on fostering social skills, self-esteem, and emotional resilience among students who have experienced bullying, to help them build stronger friendships and feel less lonely.\n4. Develop interventions targeting younger students, as they are more affected by bullying.\n5. Offer counseling services to both victims and perpetrators to address the underlying issues leading to bullying behavior and facilitate the healing process for victims.\n6. Create a safe and inclusive school environment by encouraging a culture of respect, tolerance, and empathy among students, teachers, and parents."

Encourage countries to adopt constitutional protections, as they seem to lag behind other types of protections, and are crucial for long-lasting legal security.\n3. Promote the introduction and enforcement of legal protection for the LGBTQ+ community in various aspects (employment, hate crimes, incitement) for comprehensive support.\n4. Advocate for the prohibition of conversion therapies globally, as only a few countries have taken this important step.\n5. Support legislation that promotes equal rights in the aspects of relationships and family life, such as same-sex marriage, civil unions, and adoption rights, to create a more inclusive environment worldwide."

The correlation between constitutional protection and broad legal protections is 0.36, indicating a weak positive relationship.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As the current dataset presents a weak positive relationship between constitutional protection and broad legal protections for sexual orientation, further research and data collection are recommended to investigate any other potential factors affecting these protections.\n2. The study can be expanded by including other dimensions, such as education, income, religious views, which may help identify trends and correlations that are not evident in the current dataset.\n3. To get a better understanding of the factors influencing the legal landscape, a qualitative analysis, including interviews with experts in the field, legal scholars, and social scientists, could complement the quantitative analysis.\n4. As the data has gaps and is not conclusive, the final decision should not rely solely on the current analysis. Further comprehensive research in this area is necessary before making any decisions or policy recommendations."

Of these 33 countries with second parent adoption, 27.27% have same-sex marriage, 18.18% have civil unions, and 54.55% have both same-sex marriage and civil unions.\n3. The relationship between second parent adoption and various legal rights and protections is as follows: 15.15% have constitutional protections, 84.85% have broad protections, 96.97% have employment protections, 60.61% have hate crime laws, 75.76% have incitement laws, and 9.09% have conversion therapy bans.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on the 33 countries allowing second parent adoption for a more in-depth analysis, as these countries seem to have a more comprehensive legal framework for LGBTQ+ rights.\n2. Investigate the specific legal rights and protections in each of these countries, particularly those with both same-sex marriage and civil unions, as these countries may have more progressive legal environments.\n3. Consider collaborating with regional or international LGBTQ+ organizations, as they may have valuable insight into the legal and practical realities of second parent adoption in various jurisdictions.\n4. Take into account the broader legal protections (such as employment, hate crime laws, and incitement laws) when selecting jurisdictions to study, as these protections may reflect a more supportive environment for LGBTQ+ families.\n5. Consult local attorneys or legal experts in each jurisdiction to understand the nuances of each country's legal framework for second parent adoption, as interpretations and applications of the laws may vary."

To determine insurance pricing and coverage, consider using the age (65+) and gender (females) to identify groups with higher overall wellbeing, as they have the highest work-life balance scores.\n2. Consider offering incentives for individuals who partake in wellness activities known to improve work-life balance, such as regular exercise, stress management, and healthy eating, as these factors correlate positively with wellbeing.\n3. To target younger demographic groups (15-28 and 28-43 age groups), the insurer could offer customized programs that emphasize stress reduction and weight management, as these factors are negatively correlated with work-life balance scores.\n4. Develop insurance packages that offer mental health and lifestyle support services, such as meditation sessions, weight management programs, and counseling services, to promote overall wellbeing and potentially reduce claims related to stress and obesity.\n5. Monitor the changes in work-life balance scores as well as other health indicators throughout time, to adapt and refine insurance offerings regularly based on the needs of different demographic groups."

The job category of 'retired' had the highest success rate of 27.03%, whereas 'blue-collar' jobs had the lowest success rate of 6.81%.\n3. Among marital statuses, 'unknown' had the highest success rate at 15.00%, while 'married' had the lowest success rate at 10.18%.\n4. The age group of 65+ showed the highest success rate at 53.37%, while the age group of 25-49 had the lowest success rate at 10.20%.\n5. Clients with housing loans had a higher success rate (11.95%) compared to those without housing loans (11.05%).\n6. Clients without personal loans had a slightly higher success rate (11.72%) compared to those with personal loans (10.53%).\n7. The success rate was higher with cellular contact (14.70%) compared to telephone contact (5.81%).\n8. The success rate varied significantly by month, with December showing the highest success rate at 56.52%, while May had the lowest at 7.00%.\n9. Success rates were relatively consistent across different days of the week, with Wednesday having the highest success rate (12.33%) and Monday having the lowest (10.28%).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on specific client segments such as those in the 'retired' job category, 'unknown' marital status, and older age groups (65+), as they have higher success rates compared to others.\n2. Consider tailoring marketing strategies to improve performance in the 'blue-collar' job category and the 'married' marital status.\n3. Explore offering preferential deals or products to clients with housing loans or without personal loans, as they seem to have a higher success rate.\n4. Increase the use of cellular contact instead of telephone contact as it has a significantly higher success rate.\n5. Investigate the reasons behind the varying success rates across different months, and consider adjusting marketing activities accordingly, such as focusing more efforts in months like December and less in months like May.\n6. Evaluate the effectiveness of outreach efforts on different days of the week and consider adapting the strategy to improve the success rate on Mondays."

The top 10 stations by average duration reveal that some stations are used more intensively than others, with Greenwood Ave & 47th St having the longest average trip duration.\n3. Casual riders tend to have significantly longer average trip durations (26.37 minutes) compared to members (12.82 minutes).\n4. Monthly rider type statistics display variations in total trips and average duration per trip during the year, with possible seasonal effects on bike usage.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Place new bike stations or relocate existing ones near the top 10 stations by total trips to meet the high demand in those areas.\n2. Increase bike availability and maintenance frequency at stations with the longest average trip durations, as these stations are used more intensively.\n3. Consider offering discounted membership rates or promoting bike usage among casual riders, since they have a significantly longer average trip duration compared to members.\n4. Evaluate seasonal promotional strategies to increase bike usage during months with lower total trips and/or shorter average duration per trip."

The total number of trips and average trip duration increased from January 2021 to May 2021, after which it remained relatively stable through August 2022, and then started to decline towards the end of the dataset.\n2. Casual ridership consistently contributed to a substantial portion of the total trips, indicating that many users opt for single-use rides rather than becoming members.\n3. Members generally took shorter trips on average compared to casual riders, suggesting that members might use the bikes for planned, routine commutes, while casual riders might use them for leisure activities.\n4. Classic bikes were the most popular type of bike, followed by electric bikes, and docked bikes were the least popular among all users.\n5. The average trip duration decreased slightly over time in member rides, while it increased for casual rides, implying different usage patterns between the two categories of users.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider offering promotions to casual riders to encourage them to become members, potentially capturing more long-term customers.\n2. Invest in increasing the availability of classic bikes, as they are the most popular choice among users. However, also monitor the growing trend of electric bike usage and consider providing more electric bikes to meet changing demands.\n3. Analyze the most popular routes and trip start times for members and casual riders separately, catering to each group's needs (e.g., create bicycle lanes, increase bike availability during peak times, improve infrastructure in high-demand areas).\n4. Conduct surveys of riders to understand their preferences better, along with their motivations for choosing casual membership over long-term membership and ways to improve the user experience for both member and casual riders.\n5. Implement targeted marketing campaigns aimed at casual riders during periods of higher demand, such as summertime and weekends, positioning the bike-sharing program as an ideal solution for leisure activities."

Prioritize maintenance and replacement for classic bikes, as they are the most frequently used rideable vehicle and represent the majority of usage in the dataset.\n2. Also, allocate a significant portion of resources for maintaining and replacing electric bikes, as they account for a significant portion of usage (28.82%).\n3.

Long trips (>120 minutes) were found to be present in the data, with 94.32% of these trips made by casual users.\n3. The top 2 starting and ending stations for long trips were \"Streeter Dr & Grand Ave\" and \"Millennium Park.\"\n4. Imbalance in trip flow was seen in 273 stations, with \"Michigan Ave & Oak St\" having the highest total number of trips.\n5. Analysis of trips by hour and weekday revealed that evening hours (16:00 - 18:00) on weekdays have the highest number of trips.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate locations with a high number of long trips (e.g., \"Streeter Dr & Grand Ave\" and \"Millennium Park\") for potential safety hazards, as these may be areas with inexperienced riders or challenging routes.\n2. Conduct a thorough review of stations with imbalanced trip flows and consider repositioning bike racks to accommodate peak hours and demand.\n3. Monitor high-frequency stations identified during the analysis for potential safety hazards during peak hours and consider implementing additional safety measures (e.g., improved signage or on-site staff presence).\n4. Investigate evenings on weekdays when there's a high number of trips and work with local authorities to enhance safety measures in the area (e.g., increase enforcement, improve lighting, or adjust traffic patterns).\n5. Consider providing safety education and resources (e.g., maps, informational pamphlets, or training sessions) to casual users, who have been identified as making up a large percentage of long trips (>120 minutes)."

Members accounted for 57.61% of total trips, while casual users represented 42.39%.\n3. On average, members took 6.14 trips per day, and casual users took 5.48 trips per day. The busiest days for each user type were different: June 10, 2021, for members (with 17 trips) and May 29, 2022, for casual users (with 23 trips).\n4. The most common start and end stations were different between members and casual users, with members frequently utilizing stations located in more business-oriented areas, while casual users tended to use stations close to tourist attractions.\n5. Members mainly used classic bikes (71.89% of their trips), while casual users had a more diverse usage with 57.19% classic bikes, 29.78% electric bikes, and 13.04% docked bikes.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As the average trip duration for members is significantly less than casual users, offering bike-share memberships to your employees can provide a cost-effective and time-efficient transportation option.\n2. Given that members represent a higher percentage of total trips and have an average of 6.14 trips per day, offering bike-share memberships could promote sustainability and reduce road congestion.\n3. Encourage employees to use classic bikes, as they are the most popular option among members and may offer a better-shared resource experience.\n4. Focus on providing access to bike-share stations near your company location and popular destinations for employees (e.g., lunch spots, public transportation hubs) to maximize the benefits of bike-share memberships.\n5. Monitor member usage trends in your company over time to make necessary adjustments in bike allocations and resources and ensure that your employees benefit from the bike-share system in a cost-effective and sustainable manner."

The dataset contains 118 samples of different metals with their respective magnetic permeability and inductance measurements at different distances (0cm to 100cm).\n2. There were no missing values in the dataset and a few unexpected values were cleaned for the 'inductance at 50cm' column.\n3. The average inductance for each metal across different distances showed wide variations in values, implying that each metal has a unique inductance profile. It also suggests that metals with higher magnetic permeabilities might have higher inductance at shorter distances.\n4. The correlations between magnetic permeability and inductance at the given distances are low, indicating that they don't have a strong linear relationship.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To ensure the consistency and accuracy of inductance measurements across different metals, you should consider applying standardized testing methods and calibrating your measuring equipment for each type of metal under similar conditions.\n2. As the correlation between the magnetic permeability and inductance is weak, it's essential to treat each metal separately and not rely solely on its magnetic permeability for ensuring the accuracy of the inductance measurements.\n3. You could also consider conducting further experiments to study the behavior of inductance at different distances for each metal type, allowing for establishing more accurate baselines or standards.\n4. Finally, it would be beneficial to consult with experts in the field of metals and inductance to gain deeper insights into the properties and relationships between various metals and their inductance measurements."

After the data cleaning process, the dataset appeared to be consistent and more suitable for analysis.\n2. The Pearson correlations between Magnetic Permeability and inductance values at all distances were found to be very weak (-0.034 to -0.017). This indicates that there is almost no linear relationship between these two properties in general.\n3. Removing the outlier metals from the dataset did not help in establishing any correlation between the properties, as the Pearson correlation coefficients remained NaN due to missing values in the cleaned dataset. Filling these missing values with mean values also did not affect the correlation coefficients.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Since the magnetic permeability and inductance values showed very weak correlations, it seems that they are not directly linearly related to each other in general. Therefore, it might be beneficial to look for other properties that could better explain the relationship between magnetic permeability and inductance.\n2. Investigate the non-linear relationships between these two properties, since the linear correlations are weak. A non-linear model might better describe the relationship between magnetic permeability and inductance values.\n3. As some metals have unusual inductance characteristics compared to the rest of the dataset, it might be interesting to study those metals in more depth to better understand their specific behavior and properties.\n4. Expanding the dataset with more metals and additional properties could help in discovering other relationships that may explain the inductance characteristics of the metals and improve our understanding of material behavior."

On average, Builder-posted houses have the highest prices (318.48 Lacs), followed by dealer-posted ones (180.27 Lacs).\n3. Almost all houses are BHK type (99.9%), with only a small percentage (0.1%) being RK type. BHK houses on average have higher prices (140.26 Lacs) compared to RK houses (41.35 Lacs).\n4. The size of the house (SQUARE_FT) shows a moderate correlation (0.48) with the target price, indicating that larger houses tend to have higher prices.\n5.

Consider investing in BHK-type properties because they generally have higher prices compared to RK-type properties.\n3. Look for larger houses (in terms of SQUARE_FT) to potentially get better returns, as there's a positive correlation between house size and price.\n4. Prioritize properties located in the top 10 most profitable locations (based on median house prices) to maximize profit potential.\n5. Avoid investing in properties situated in the bottom 10 least profitable locations, as their median house prices are significantly lower compared to other locations."

The most frequent type of property seller is a dealer, followed by owners and builders.\n3. Most properties in the dataset are BHKs (Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen), with very few RKs (Room and Kitchen) available.\n4. There is a wide variety of locations and addresses for these properties.\n5. No strong correlations were found between the provided features and the target variable (house price).\n6. A new feature, price per square foot, was created, but it also did not show a strong correlation with the house price.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider focusing on houses posted by owners, as they have a lower average price compared to dealers and builders.\n2. Based on the dataset, it is challenging to identify the best deals on properties solely using the provided features.\n3. It is recommended to gather more information and additional features to better predict house prices and identify the best deals (e.g., neighborhood quality, nearby amenities, public transportation access, etc.).\n4. Collaborate with experts in the real estate field or consult real estate listing websites with advanced filtering options to further assist in finding the best deals on properties."

The size of the dataset is quite large, with 14,726 properties.\n3. The correlations between the features and the target variable (TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)) are relatively weak, with the strongest correlation being with the SQUARE_FT feature (0.48).\n4. The categorical features showed varying relationships with the target variable, with properties posted by Builders having the highest average price (318.48 Lacs), followed by Dealers (180.27 Lacs), and Owners (60.52 Lacs).\n5. The linear regression model used to predict property prices had relatively high errors, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 561.14 Lacs and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 128.23 Lacs.\n6. The RandomForestRegressor model had lower errors compared to the linear regression model, with a RMSE of 410.66 Lacs and a MAE of 44.74 Lacs.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider using the RandomForestRegressor model to evaluate property values as it has lower errors compared to the linear regression model.\n2. Investigate incorporating additional features (e.g., property age, nearby amenities) into the analysis, which may improve model accuracy.\n3. Consider using more complex machine learning models (e.g., gradient boosting, neural networks) to potentially further improve prediction performance.\n4. Perform feature engineering to create new features or transform existing features, which may help capture non-linearities and increase model accuracy.\n5. Since the highest correlation is with the SQUARE_FT feature, focus on obtaining accurate SQUARE_FT values for properties to improve the reliability of the predictions."

The average property price is 140.19 lacs, with a large variance of 422,912.91, indicating that property prices vary greatly and are not tightly concentrated around the mean.\n2. Square footage (SQUARE_FT) has the highest correlation (0.48) with property prices, followed by the number of bedrooms (BHK_NO.) at 0.10.\n3. Other features like RERA, UNDER_CONSTRUCTION, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, READY_TO_MOVE, and RESALE have weak to negligible correlations with property prices.\n4. Dealers and builders usually deal with properties that have higher prices compared to owners, as the mean prices for properties posted by them are 180.27 and 318.48 lacs, respectively, compared to owner-posted properties with a mean price of 60.52 lacs.\n5. Regular bedroom (BHK) properties have higher mean and median prices compared to room-kitchen (RK) properties.\n6. The mean and median property prices vary across different addresses, indicating that location has a significant impact on property prices.\n7. As the number of bedrooms (BHK_NO.) increases, there is a general increase in mean and median property prices and mean price per square foot, although there are some exceptions.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on properties with larger SQUARE_FT and higher BHK_NO. numbers since they have a stronger impact on property prices, which will help in better estimating property taxes.\n2. Explore regional tax rates based on locations (ADDRESS), considering the substantial variation in property prices across different locations.\n3. Investigate the patterns in the property prices and square footage within each location more closely. Understanding these relationships can help make more informed decisions about tax rates for different regions.\n4. Monitor high-end properties, especially those posted by dealers and builders since they are associated with higher property prices and have the potential to generate more significant tax revenue.\n5. Consider analyzing additional information about properties, such as age, quality of construction, amenities, and proximity to local infrastructure like schools, hospitals, and transportation, which can also affect property values and tax revenue estimates.\n6. Update the data regularly and conduct periodic analyses to identify trends and changes in the property market, ensuring accurate tax assessments."

The majority of properties are of type BHK with 14,715 instances compared to only 11 instances of RK type.\n3. The most common number of bedrooms in the dataset is 2, with a vast majority of properties having 1 to 4 bedrooms.\n4. The size of the house (SQUARE_FT) has a moderate positive correlation (0.48) with the target price.\n5. The `RERA` status, the role of the person who posted the property (`POSTED_BY`), and the house `RESALE` status have some impact on the target price.\n6. The location of the property (LONGITUDE and LATITUDE) has a weak negative correlation with the target price (-0.04 and -0.02, respectively).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To price your property competitively, take into consideration the size of your house, as there is a moderate correlation between size and price. As a benchmark, the median price per square foot for properties in the dataset is 0.05084 lakh.\n2. Analyze other properties with similar characteristics, such as the number of bedrooms, location, and whether the property is a BHK or RK type, to determine an appropriate price range.\n3. If possible, obtain a `RERA` approval for your property, as this may positively influence the price of your property.\n4. When listing your property, consider mentioning whether it is posted by an Owner, Dealer, or Builder, as this may influence the perceived value and attractiveness of your property.\n5. If the property is not to be resold, position your property as new by highlighting its features and improved condition to justify a higher price.\n6. Consider the impact of your property's location on its price, and highlight any nearby attractions or amenities that may positively influence its value."

The number of BHK (bedroom, hall, kitchen) properties is significantly more than RK (room and kitchen) properties.\n4. House prices are positively correlated with square footage (0.48), and to a lesser extent, other factors such as RERA approval and number of BHKs.\n5. The median price per square foot is 5,084.\n6. Locally, certain areas have higher median house prices and price per square footage than others. \n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on regions with higher price per square footage and median house prices to better understand their impact on the overall economy.\n2. Consider the development of BHK properties, as they seem to be in higher demand and have a wider price range compared to RK properties.\n3. Investigate further into the Dealers' and Builders' sales strategy, as they might hold potential insights on profitable real estate investments.\n4. Examine the difference in house prices for RERA-approved properties, which might indicate a higher quality but also come with additional costs.\n5. Analyze fluctuations in house prices and sales over time to better understand the impact on the economy. This would require looking at a time series dataset of house prices.\n6. Consider trends in property investors' preferences, such as local amenities or luxury features, which might influence market demand and affect future house price trends."

This may provide useful information on the potential impact of policies associated with property regulations and standards.\n4. Analyze the role that different stakeholders, such as builders and dealers, play in the housing market, as they appear to have varying effects on housing prices.\n5. Examine the relationship between property type (BHK or RK) and housing prices, as different types of properties might respond differently to the policies.\n6. Lastly, consider coupling the quantitative analysis with qualitative research, such as field studies and interviews with policymakers, builders, dealers, and property owners, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting housing prices and the effectiveness of current policies."

Properties posted by Builders have the highest average price, followed by Dealers and then Owners.\n2. Properties that are under construction demand a higher average price than those that are ready to move in.\n3. RERA-approved properties have a higher average price compared to non-approved ones.\n4. As the number of bedrooms (BHK_NO.) increases, the average property price generally increases as well.\n5. The size of the property (SQUARE_FT) has a strong positive correlation with the price, whereas the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) have weak correlations with the price.\n6. Using geographical location data, we clustered the properties into 5 groups. Each of these clusters has differing numbers of properties and different average prices.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize evaluating properties posted by Builders or Dealers as collateral, as they generally have a higher average price, making them potentially more valuable.\n2. Consider properties that are under construction as collateral, as their average price is higher. This could also mean higher value for your investment.\n3. Assess RERA-approved properties more favorably, since their approval may indicate a more secure investment and their average price is higher.\n4. Take into account the number of bedrooms when evaluating collateral. Generally, properties with more bedrooms have higher prices and potentially higher value.\n5. Properties within location clusters with higher average prices could be considered more valuable. Prioritize clusters with higher average prices to minimize the risk when setting collateral."

Women on average live longer than men (72.80 years for women vs. 70.02 years for men).\n3. Top 3 most common occupations in the dataset are Artist (28%), Politician (21%), and Athlete (13%).\n4. The dataset mostly consists of individuals from the United States (19%), Germany (11%), and France (9%).\n5. Over time, the average age of death generally increases, with notable improvements for individuals born after 1875, and a peak for those born between 1900 and 1925.\n6. Occupational differences in average age of death is observed, with Suffragist having the highest average age of death (99.00 years), followed by Physiologist (96.00 years) and Sniper (95.00 years). \n7. In the top 5 occupations and top 5 countries, the United Kingdom has the highest average age of death across all occupations.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider formulating public policies that target different age groups based on the observed age distribution. Policies for middle-aged and older individuals should focus on improving their quality of life and access to healthcare services, while the youth should be educated on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n2. Investigate the underlying factors that contribute to the higher life expectancy of women compared to men. Public policies and awareness campaigns should be developed to address and mitigate these factors to improve the life expectancy of men.\n3. As Artists, Politicians, and Athletes are the most prevalent occupations in the dataset, policies should be tailored to cater to the specific needs and demands of these sectors, focusing on areas such as work-life balance, mental and physical health, and vocational training.\n4. Design public policy interventions and collaborations that consider cultural and regional differences. The dataset is predominantly comprised of people from the United States, Germany, and France, so policies should be tailored to cater to these countries.\n5. Keep monitoring the age trends over time. The observed increase in the average age of death may signify improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and other aspects that contributed to an increase in life expectancy. In contrast, the decline observed for individuals born after 1925 might be due to incomplete data since some of them may still be alive. Policies should be geared towards addressing the aging population's needs.\n6. Investigate the relationship between occupation and life expectancy, identifying occupations with exceptional patterns on life expectancy, and considering them in policy design. For instances where an occupation is associated with a higher life expectancy, identify strategies to replicate those factors to other professions.\n7. Collaborate with other countries, especially those that demonstrate higher life expectancy, such as the United Kingdom, to study and implement successful healthcare policies and models."

The dataset is predominantly male, with 90.02% of the entries being male and 9.98% female.\n3. The top countries represented in the dataset are the United States, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.\n4. The top occupations in the dataset are artist, politician, athlete, and researcher.\n5. Females have a slightly higher average age of death (72.80 years) compared to males (70.02 years).\n6. People in the teaching profession have the highest average age of death (76.02 years) among the top 10 occupations, while military personnel has the lowest (65.20 years).\n7. The average age of death has generally increased over the decades, with some fluctuations.\n8. Life expectancy at age 65 has also generally increased over the decades, with some fluctuations.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider using the average age of death for different occupations, countries, and genders to adjust pricing models for life insurance products.\n2. Include the trends observed in age of death and life expectancy over time while predicting future mortality rates, to account for improvements in healthcare and living conditions.\n3. Further investigation could be done to identify other potential risk factors, such as lifestyle and family health history, that may contribute to differences in mortality risk among different clienteles.\n4. Based on the trends observed, clients in teaching and research occupations may be considered lower-risk compared to clients in military or athletic occupations.\n5. Additional data, such as socio-economic factors and access to healthcare, could be incorporated into the analysis to develop a more comprehensive mortality risk assessment and improve pricing models."

The top 5 occupations in the dataset are artists, politicians, athletes, researchers, and military personnel.\n3. Overall, the life expectancy has a mean of 70.29 years and a median of 73 years.\n4. The median life expectancy varies across occupations and genders, with different occupational life expectancy trends for males and females.\n5. Some occupations have significant life expectancy gaps between males and females, such as printmaker, revolutionary, and anthropologist (females outliving males), and astronomer, fencer, and lawyer (males outliving females).\n6. Life expectancy increases in general from the birth decade -400 to 1980, with a peak in the birth decade of 1920 (82 years median life expectancy). However, the life expectancy decreases significantly for individuals born after 1940.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Perform further analysis to find causation, as the current outcomes only provide correlations between occupation, gender, and life expectancy.\n2. Investigate the factors that contribute to the observed life expectancy gaps between genders in specific occupations, such as work environment, work-life balance, or job-related stress.\n3. Examine the influence of historical events and changes in healthcare, social mobility, or education on life expectancy trends across time.\n4. Explore other variables in the dataset, like the country of origin or short description, that may affect the relationship between occupation, gender, and life expectancy.\n5. Consider collecting more detailed data on work conditions, income, family background, and health history to provide a more complete picture of the factors affecting life expectancy in various occupations and genders."

The average age of death in the dataset is 70.29 years, with a standard deviation of 15.90 years, indicating that there may be contributing factors to early mortality.\n2. Females in the dataset had a slightly higher average age of death (72.80 years) compared to males (70.02 years).\n3. The top three most correlated factors with age of death were Birth year, Death year, and Gender.\n4. There seems to be a trend of increasing average age of death as birth years progress, with those born between 1950-2000 having the lowest average age of death (47.08 years).\n5. There are notable differences in age of death distribution across different occupations. For instance, military personnel had the lowest average age of death (65.20 years), while teachers had the highest (76.02 years).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Further delve into the relationship between birth year and age of death to understand whether this association is influenced by other factors.\n2. Investigate specific factors that might contribute to the differences in age of death between males and females.\n3. Analyze the underlying reasons behind the differences in age of death across various occupations to identify potential risk factors for early mortality.\n4. Explore the dataset for any age-related diseases or other health conditions that could be associated with early mortality.\n5. Consider expanding the analysis to include additional factors such as lifestyle choices, socio-economic conditions, and genetic predispositions that could potentially influence age of death and age-related diseases."

After mapping the occupations to education levels (Low, Medium, High, Unknown), there were 3435 individuals with 'Unknown' education level, 1701 with 'Medium', 766 with 'Low', and 82 with 'High' education level.\n3. The correlation between Education Level and Age of Death (Life Expectancy) is 0.057, which is very weak and far from statistically significant.\n4. The average age of death varies slightly between different education levels: High (72.33), Low (68.48), Medium (70.23), and Unknown (70.68) education levels.\n5. The median age of death also varies slightly between different education levels: High (75.50), Low (72.00), Medium (73.00), and Unknown (73.00) education levels.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Based on the weak correlation between education level and life expectancy, there does not seem to be a strong relationship between the two factors in this dataset.\n2. The dataset needs further cleaning by finding the exact education level of the individuals in the 'Unknown' category or enhancing the occupation-to-education level mapping to be more inclusive.\n3. It would be helpful to explore other variables (such as country of origin or gender) to identify potential factors that could impact life expectancy and their relationships with education levels.\n4. The dataset may benefit from additional data points to increase the representativeness of the population and improve the analysis.\n5. Consider investigating the relationship between education level and life expectancy using other datasets or through a more expansive data collection process for a better understanding of the potential correlation."

The average age of death in the dataset is 70.29 years, with a standard deviation of 15.90 years, indicating a relatively wide range of ages at death.\n2. Females in the dataset tend to have a higher average age of death (72.80 years) compared to males (70.02 years).\n3. The age at death has generally increased over time, with some fluctuations in different decades.\n4. The distribution of ages at death is quite wide, with an Interquartile Range (IQR) of 21.00 years, highlighting the variation in life expectancy.\n5. A small percentage of outliers (approximately 1.92%) have notably lower ages of death.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the causes of death for the outliers with notably lower ages of death to uncover potential patterns that may be addressed through targeted interventions.\n2. Analyze the specific causes of death for both males and females to understand the factors contributing to the observed differences in life expectancy which can inform gender-specific interventions.\n3. Examine trends in the causes of death across different decades to identify patterns that may be related to changes in healthcare, lifestyle, or other factors that can guide preventive care strategies.\n4. Explore correlations between causes of death and occupations. Understanding the relationships between specific occupations and causes of death may suggest the need for occupation-specific interventions and preventative measures.\n5. Conduct further research on the countries and demographic groups with particularly high or low average ages of death to identify potential healthcare disparities or unique health-related factors that can inform targeted interventions."

The number of paragraphs per document ranges from 1 to 3, with some documents having more paragraphs than others.\n4. All templates have an associated date range, but all of them appear to have already expired.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Review and potentially update the templates with the most documents (IDs 25, 14, and 11) to ensure compliance with current legal requirements.\n2. Assess the need for additional templates in each template type, especially for the less represented template types (CV and AD).\n3. Review the paragraph structure of the documents and consider standardizing the number and content of paragraphs for better consistency across documents.\n4. Verify the expiration dates of the templates and update the effective dates for those templates that are currently in use or will be used in the future. It is critical to have up-to-date templates to ensure continued legal and compliance adherence."

        "content": "## Final report\n### Findings\n1. There are 5 different template types utilized in the database, with the most frequent ones being 'PP' and 'BK', both having 6 records each.\n2. The average version number per template ID is 5.15, suggesting that templates get updated quite frequently.\n3. The date range of the templates' effective dates starts from 1975-05-20 to 2012-04-05, while the expiration date for these templates varies from 1973-01-12 to 2015-09-06.\n4. The number of documents being utilized for various template types are: 5 for 'BK', 4 for 'PP', 3 for 'PPT', and 3 for 'AD'.\n5. The distribution of documents across templates shows that three templates (with Template IDs 11, 14, and 25) have two documents each, while the remaining templates have one document each.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Based on the high average version number, it's recommended to review the templates that haven't been updated recently, especially those created before 2000.\n2. Consider re-evaluating the expired templates (effective to date before the current date) to see if they still hold value, require updates, or can be removed from the system.\n3. Given that Template Types 'BK' and 'PP' are the most frequently used, prioritize the review and update process for documents associated with these types.\n4. Templates with multiple documents (Template IDs 11, 14, and 25) should be checked for redundancy or similarities and updated accordingly. This might help streamline the onboarding and training process by reducing duplicate content.\n5. Analyze the content of the documents and paragraphs (content in 'Document_Description' and 'Paragraph_Text') to identify areas that require improvement or have become outdated."

All Template_Type_Codes are alphanumeric and well-formatted.\n3. The numeric columns in the tables show diverse statistics, including template versions and paragraph counts.\n4. There are 15 documents in the database, which use various templates.\n5. Some Template's effectiveness periods show discrepancies with the Date_Effective_From being later than the Date_Effective_To.\n6. Documents are sorted based on their Template's effectiveness period, with varying durations and starting dates.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate and correct the discrepancies in the Templates' Date_Effective_From and Date_Effective_To columns to ensure template accuracy.\n2. Ensure that new templates or template modifications go through a quality control process to maintain consistency in Template_Type_Code format and effectiveness period validity.\n3. Since some documents do not have any paragraphs, review them for completeness and consider adding paragraph content to maintain document accuracy.\n4. Frequently monitor the performance of various template types (PP, BK, PPT, AD, and CV) to ensure they meet the specific needs of the documents.\n5. Implement a mechanism to prevent creating or updating templates with invalid date ranges, assisting in maintaining accuracy and consistency.\n6. Periodically review and update templates based on their effectiveness and relevance to the documents to maintain quality and consistency."

Among the available template types (AD, BK, CV, PP, PPT), the number of documents and paragraphs varies, with BK (book) template types having the lowest average number of paragraphs per document (0.4) and AD (advertisement) template types having the highest (1.67).\n3. There's a weak positive correlation (0.3199) between the date range a template is effective and the number of documents associated with that template. In other words, templates with a longer \"Date_Effective_Range\" tend to have more documents associated with them, but this relationship is not strong.\n4. There is a wide range of template versions and the date range they cover. However, newer versions don't always have more documents associated with them, suggesting that the usage of templates is not strictly tied to their versions or the dates they were effective.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider reviewing the most popular template types (i.e., those with the highest number of documents and paragraphs) to standardize documentation, and focus on improving and promoting their usage across teams.\n2. Conduct a qualitative analysis of template types and their versions, as the weak correlation between \"Date_Effective_Range\" and the number of documents suggests that there might be other factors influencing the usage of templates.\n3. Engage with teams to better understand their preferences, needs, and potential barriers when using specific template types to drive team collaboration. This information can be used to refine and optimize the templates and their versions.\n4. Consider creating a centralized template repository, along with guidelines on choosing appropriate templates and versions, in order to streamline the process of documentation standardization and enhance project team collaboration."

Analyze a larger dataset of tweets to uncover more trends, as the current dataset is limited, having only 8 tweets and 7 users.\n2. Study the relationship between users' tweeting behaviors (time of day, frequency, word choice) and their account engagement (likes, retweets, mentions, etc.) to develop a predictive model based on these factors.\n3.

Austria has the highest average length and speed for roller coasters, while Sweden has the highest average height.\n3. The roller coaster features Length, Height, and Speed are all positively correlated with each other, which means that as one of these features increases, the others are likely to increase as well.\n4. The ranking of roller coasters based on the weighted scoring considers Length (40%), Height (30%), and Speed (30%).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Since you are looking to make an informed decision on which roller coasters to add to your park, consider focusing on roller coasters with a higher-than-average Length, Height, and Speed.\n2. Evaluate the top-ranked roller coasters from the weighted scoring, which incorporates Length, Height, and Speed, as they may provide a better overall experience for park visitors.\n3. Consider commissioning roller coasters from Austria and Sweden, as they have higher average roller coaster Length, Height, and Speed values compared to other countries in the dataset.\n4. Keep in mind the positive correlation between Length, Height, and Speed when making decisions on new roller coasters, as investing in a roller coaster with high values in one of these features may also result in higher values for the other features.\n5. Continuously update and analyze the dataset as new roller coasters are introduced, to maintain an up-to-date understanding of the global roller coaster trends and make future decisions based on the latest data."

Actors from the top 10 list appear quite evenly across various film categories, showcasing their versatility in different roles.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Given the high number of films in the Sports, Foreign, and Family categories, consider starting by watching movies from these categories to have a wider selection of films to explore.\n2. If you're interested in watching films with top actors, you might want to consider watching films featuring Gina Degeneres, Walter Torn, or Mary Keitel.\n3. For shorter films, you may want to choose from the Documentary category, while if you prefer longer films, you can choose from the Sports category.\n4. As the rental rates are quite similar across categories, you can focus on selecting films based on the content and actors without worrying about price differences.\n5. Since the presence of top 10 actors is evenly distributed across various categories, you can explore different genres without missing out on their performances."

The majority of the documents are stored in location X (5 documents) and location E (4 documents). Locations B, C, and N store fewer documents.\n3. Most documents have a negative storage duration, which indicates that the Date_in_Locaton_To is earlier than the Date_in_Location_From. This could be an error in the data.\n4. The planned and actual destruction dates for most documents are different, with only 1 document having the same dates.\n5. Destruction authorizations and executions are distributed across various employees, with employees 55 and 183 authorizing the most destructions and employee 173 executing most destructions.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the cause of the negative storage durations and correct the data for accurate analysis.\n2. Check if the disproportionate distribution of documents across locations is intentional or the result of oversight.\n3. Verify if document storage and destruction are following appropriate policies and procedures, given that most planned and actual destruction dates are different.\n4. Examine if there is a need to distribute destruction authorizations and executions more evenly among employees or introduce a more systematic approach.\n5. Consider implementing a tracking system or regular audits to monitor the accuracy and consistency of document storage and destruction practices."

The distribution of documents among locations shows that Xiamen holds the largest number of documents (5 documents), while Nanjing holds the lowest number (1 document).

Review the regulatory requirements for different document types and locations, and compare them with the current document storage duration to ensure compliance.\n2. Investigate the reasons behind the varying storage durations to ensure that no documents are stored for a period that exceeds the regulatory requirements.\n3. Consider implementing a regular review process to verify that documents are stored and destroyed according to the prescribed retention policies, and that destroyed documents are documented and properly disposed of.\n4. Keep track of the document distribution across locations and document types to ensure that retention resources are managed effectively and efficiently.\n5. Continuously monitor these findings and make adjustments to the document retention policy as required, ensuring changes are communicated to all relevant parties."

Verify whether any inconsistencies in the data exist, such as documents being destroyed before the planned date, as this might indicate discrepancies in record-keeping or issues in the destruction process.\n2. Cross-check the document type (CV, Book, Paper, or Review) and location information to ensure that they correctly represent the documents' current and past status.\n3. Review the process of document destruction authorizations to ensure that documents are properly approved for destruction, and proper timelines are defined."

Consider consolidating the storage of documents with shorter durations to minimize costs and optimize retrieval times.\n2. Evaluate the need for long-term storage, especially for documents stored beyond 20 years.\n3. Prioritize digitization of documents with storage durations longer than 10 years to minimize physical storage space.\n4. Allocate resources to maintain and organize the storage locations (Xiamen and Edinburgh) with higher document concentrations.\n5.

The average document age is 33.5 years, with the oldest document being 47.1 years old, and the youngest document being 13.9 years old.\n3. The documents are stored in five different locations: Xiamen (5), Edinburgh (4), Brazil (3), Canada (2), and Nanjing (1).\n4. The actual destruction of documents usually deviates from the planned destruction dates, with an average delay of 5.6 years. Some documents were destroyed earlier, with the maximum delay being -30.3 years, while others were destroyed later, with a maximum delay of 37.4 years.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. To improve efficiency, consider consolidating the storage locations or using a centralized document management system, as the current data is spread across five different locations.\n2. Regularly review and update document types in the system to ensure they accurately represent the organization's documents, as the current dataset has a limited number of categories.\n3. Implement a more effective tracking system for document age and periodically analyze the age distribution to help identify and prioritize documents for destruction or archiving.\n4. Develop and enforce strict document destruction policies to minimize the deviations between planned and actual destruction dates, maintaining compliance and ensuring timely disposal of unnecessary documents.\n5. Consider investing in document management software with features such as document versioning, access control, and centralized storage, which could potentially help streamline document handling processes and improve efficiency in the long run."

The progress of votes shows that Contestant 2 received their only vote first, followed by Contestant 3 who received both of their votes consecutively, and finally Contestant 5 received their only vote.\n6. The cross-tabulation of votes per contestant and state indicates that Contestant 2 received votes only from NY, Contestant 3 received votes from both NY and CA, and Contestant 5 received votes only from NJ.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. Based on the voting behavior, focus efforts on targeting potential voters in states with higher voting rates, like New York, to increase overall voter engagement.\n2. Given that Contestant 3 received votes from 2 unique phone numbers, consider analyzing further factors that may have contributed to their higher voter count in order to develop a predictive model for voting behavior.\n3. Advance research on the influence of the time-of-day effect on voting behavior, as all votes in this dataset were cast during the 19th hour of the day.\n4. Develop a predictive model to identify the, as of now, unknown factors impacting voters' choices for contestants, by analyzing the voting history, demographic information, and preferences of voters who cast their votes for a particular contestant.\n5. Expand the dataset with more diverse data from different locations and time ranges to better predict voting habits across the US and strengthen the predictive model.\n6. Lastly, consider conducting surveys or gathering qualitative data from voters in order to understand factors influencing their voting decisions better and apply that information to the predictive model."
