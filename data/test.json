Swimming seems to have an effect on hair loss, with average hair loss being lower for individuals who swim (1.51) compared to those who do not swim (1.72).\n3. The choice of shampoo brand also impacts hair loss, with Pantene users having a lower average hair loss (1.46) than Hair & Shoulder users (1.77).\n4. Stress levels have a strong relationship with hair loss, where high and very high stress levels lead to significantly higher average hair loss (2.61 and 2.75, respectively) compared to low and medium stress levels (1.43 and 1.69, respectively).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Promote Pantene shampoo in the store as it has a lower average hair loss rate than Hair & Shoulder shampoo.\n2. Make recommendations to customers that hair washing habits have little difference (small effect) on hair loss, but it is still essential to maintain good hair hygiene.\n3. Include swimming products (swimming caps, chlorine-removing shampoos) in the store, and suggest customers add swimming to their activities as it helps maintain healthy hair.\n4. To help customers with stress management, consider introducing stress relief products (e.g., essential oils, stress-relief balls) and promote their benefits in reducing hair loss."

Users show a higher interest in chatting and making friends compared to dating.\n4. Across different age groups, there is a general decrease in interest for chatting and making friends, and an increase in interest for dating (except for age 27, which shows an unusually high percentage of wanting chats and zero interest in friends and dates).\n5. German (DE) is the most spoken language among users, followed by French (FR) and English (EN).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on targeting female users in the age range of 19-26, as they are the majority age group in our dataset, and their interests seem to align with our app features (chatting and making friends).\n2. Explore partnerships with brands that cater to the younger female demographic, such as fashion, beauty, or lifestyle brands.\n3. Consider collaborations with language-related companies, e.g., language learning apps and language exchange groups, as users in our dataset speak many different languages, with German, French, and English being the most popular.\n4. Develop or enhance the app's dating feature, as the user's interest in dating increases with age, potentially attracting older users as well.\n5. Investigate the unusual trend at the age of 27 and consider removing the potential outliers from the dataset if they appear to be inconsistent or erroneous."

Establish partnerships with countries that have successfully resettled refugees, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, to learn from their experiences and explore potential resettlement agreements.\n3. Consider demographics when creating resettlement policies, taking into account the age and gender composition of the refugee population to provide targeted assistance and better integrate them into society.\n4. Prioritize the allocation of resources, such as education, healthcare, and employment, to the largest age group of 18-59 years old.\n5. Develop focused support programs for refugees from the top countries of origin, such as Afghanistan, Syria, and Sudan, addressing their specific needs, challenges, and socio-cultural backgrounds.\n6. Engage international organizations and NGOs to support the implementation of resettlement policies and assistance programs for refugees."

In terms of texture, 35% of fruits are crisp, 33% are smooth, and 33% are soft.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. If you prefer a crisp texture, choose Apples.\n2. If you prefer a soft texture, choose Bananas.\n3. If you prefer a smooth texture, choose Oranges.\n4. If you want a heavier fruit, Oranges are generally the heaviest.\n5. If you want a lighter fruit, choose Bananas.\n6. Considering color preferences, you have more color options with Apples, which come in both Red and Green.\n7.

Among the players in the 2023 NBA season, the average age was 26, and the most common positions were Shooting Guard (SG) and Center (C), while the least common were Guard (G) and Forward (F).\n2. The top players in terms of points, rebounds, and assists per game include well-known names such as Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and James Harden.\n3. There is a weak positive correlation between age and performance (points, rebounds, and assists), suggesting that older players, on average, perform slightly better in these categories.\n4. A stronger positive correlation was observed between minutes played and performance in all categories (points, rebounds, and assists), indicating that players tend to perform better when they spend more time on the court.\n5. Field goal percentage (shooting efficiency) has a positive correlation with points and rebounds per game, but almost no correlation with assists per game.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Students should focus on developing their skills in scoring (points), rebounding, and playmaking (assists), as those are key performance indicators in the NBA.\n2. Students should work on shooting efficiency (field goal percentage) to increase their points and rebounds per game, but they should also develop other aspects of their gameplay, such as ball-handling and decision-making, as shooting efficiency does not strongly impact assists.\n3. Encourage students to work on their physical endurance and on-court stamina, as higher minutes played are associated with better overall performance in the game.\n4. Versatility can be important for a basketball career; students might consider developing their skills to be competent in multiple positions on the court.\n5. Continual improvement should be emphasized, as the weak positive correlation between age and performance suggests that older players, who have more experience, tend to have slightly better performance levels."

The top 5 highest-scoring players for the season are Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n2. Domantas Sabonis has the highest rebounds, and Trae Young leads in assists.\n3. The performance of players based on positions shows the highest-scoring players mostly belong to the PG, SG, and SF positions. Their average ages by position are 29 for Centers (C), 24 for Guards (G), 25 for Forwards (F), 26 for Power Forwards (PF), and 27 for Small Forwards (SF).\n4. Unfortunately, there were unresolved issues calculating the win ratio for the top 5 teams with the highest-scoring players.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on scouting and acquiring players in high-scoring positions such as Point Guards (PG), Shooting Guards (SG), and Small Forwards (SF) to improve a team's scoring potential.\n2. Consider the age of players when making decisions about potential acquisitions or investments, as younger players may have more potential for growth.\n3. Further investigation of the win ratio for top-scoring teams might give better insights into the correlation between top-scoring teams and their success in the league.\n4. Explore the possibility of using more advanced statistical measures or machine learning algorithms to uncover hidden trends or patterns in the data and predict player performance accurately."

However, after filtering out rows with negative or zero distances/fares, and extreme values, the range becomes more reasonable, with most fares between $1 to $10 per kilometer.\n2. On average, a typical Uber ride has 1.68 passengers, ranging from 0 to 6 passengers per ride.\n3. The distance of Uber trips varies significantly, with an average of 3.43 kilometers for the filtered dataset with reasonable fares. Rides can be as short as 250 meters or as long as 48.71 kilometers.\n4. There is a strong correlation (0.93) between the distance of a trip and the fare amount for rides with reasonable fares, which means that the fare amount generally increases with longer distances.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Using Uber for short trips within a few kilometers might be efficient and cost-effective, considering the fare rates between $1 to $10 per kilometer. However, for longer trips or trips with an unusually high cost per kilometer, alternative transportation options, like public transit or renting a car, might be more economical.\n2. Since there might be outliers or extreme values in fares, it is essential to monitor trip costs regularly and compare them with alternative transportation options.\n3. For rides with multiple passengers (2-6 passengers), considering services like UberPOOL or UberXL can allow for cost sharing and may result in lower costs per participant.\n4. Using Uber frequently for short trips may also be profitable given the high demand and relatively low transportation costs, especially during peak hours or periods of high demand."

However, the coefficients are not too strong, suggesting that no single factor is dominating the fare price.\n2. The average fare amount per passenger count ranges from $9.03 to $11.92, with no significant difference regardless of the number of passengers.\n3. The mean distance traveled per passenger count has some variation, but on average, a trip is around 3.13 to 29.51 km, depending on the number of passengers.\n4. The average fare amount and total fare amount vary across different times of the day and days of the week. Peak times appear to be during late evening and night (18:00 - 21:00) and on weekdays (Monday through Friday).\n5. On average, the distances traveled are longer during peak times and on weekdays.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Implementing Uber as a transportation option in your city would be feasible, considering the relatively consistent fare costs across various passenger counts and times.\n2. It is also beneficial to prioritize services during the peak times (late evening and night) and on weekdays, as they have higher total fare amounts and longer travel distances.\n3. To ensure riders have a fair pricing structure, monitor the relationships between fare_amount, distance, passenger_count, and hour, making any necessary adjustments.\n4. To better serve the city's transportation needs, consider collaborating with other regional transportation options that complement Uber's services during times that show a lower demand for rides."

Fares and distance traveled vary depending on passenger count and whether the trip occurred during rush hour.\n6. Fares, distances, and trip counts also vary by day of the week, with weekends having higher average fares and longer distances compared to weekdays.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Implement a minimum fare to ensure that very short trips (less than 0.1 km) are not unfairly charged high fares.\n2. Investigate other factors contributing to fare calculation, as the correlation between distance and fare amount is low.\n3. Evaluate the necessity of a fare surcharge during rush hour to accommodate increased demand and encourage more drivers to work during peak hours.\n4. Consider implementing dynamic pricing based on day of the week to better reflect demand and trip distances.\n5. Monitor Uber's fare calculation algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency for both drivers and riders."

The average fare amount has been gradually increasing from 2009 to 2015.\n\n3. The average fare amount per passenger is also increasing over the years.\n\n4. The correlation between fare amount and pickup/dropoff locations and passenger count is low, indicating that these factors may not have a strong impact on fare amounts.\n\n5. There is a significant variation in daily fare amounts and passenger counts, with weekends having higher average fares and passenger counts than weekdays.\n\n6. The hourly variation in fare amounts and passenger counts shows peak hours during early mornings (4-5 am) and late evenings (11 pm-12 am).\n\n7. The correlation between fare amount and distance is only 0.04, which is weak, showing that fare amount may not necessarily depend on the distance traveled.\n\n8. The median fare amount per kilometer is 3.86%.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. The increasing fare amounts over the years could signal that Uber is adjusting its pricing strategy to maximize revenue, potentially indicating a business opportunity for investors.\n\n2. As the fare amounts vary based on the day of the week and the hour, Uber may benefit from dynamic pricing strategies during peak hours and weekends to capitalize on the high demand.\n\n3. Considering the weak correlation between fare amount and distance, and fare amount and location, it's advisable to explore other factors that may contribute to higher fare amounts such as demand, type of ride, or driver ratings.\n\n4. Investors should monitor the factors driving the steady increase in fare amounts per passenger to assess if there is a long-term potential to maintain or grow this trend.\n\n5. While evaluating the financial performance of Uber using the fare information, it's essential to factor in other aspects of the business such as operating expenses, driver payouts, and competition to make holistic investment recommendations."

The average distance traveled is 25.72 km, with a standard deviation of 433.57 km. However, there are some extreme outliers in the distance data (max distance of 8708.23 km), which indicates possible data errors or unique trips.\n3. The average number of passengers is 1.68, with a standard deviation of 1.31.\n4. There is a weak positive correlation (0.04) between fare_amount and distance, implying that fare_amount is not completely determined by distance. Similarly, there's almost no correlation between fare_amount and passenger_count.\n5. There's one trip with a negative fare amount, which could be an error in the dataset.\n6. The proportion of trips with zero distance traveled is 2.31%, which might represent data inaccuracies or very short trips.\n7. There are 38 trips with abnormally long distances (greater than 100 km) and 24 trips with zero passengers, which could represent errors or unique situations.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To assess fair pricing, it's important to focus on the relationship between fare_amount and distance. Due to the weak correlation between these two variables, further data and analysis are required to make a definitive conclusion.\n2. Prioritize removing or investigating potential outliers and erroneous data points (negative fares, zero distance, long distances, and zero passengers) to improve the accuracy of the analysis.\n3. For a more accurate assessment of fair pricing, consider obtaining data on trip duration or historical pricing data, as these could provide additional insights into the fare structure.\n4. To better understand how passenger_count impacts fare_amount, acquire and analyze data on group or shared rides where fares could be split among multiple passengers.\n5. It may be helpful to investigate factors beyond fare_amount, distance, and passenger_count that could affect Uber's pricing structure, such as time of day, location, or surge pricing."

The average trip_distance is 3.35 km for the filtered dataset.\n3. There is a strong positive correlation between fare_amount and trip_distance (0.857), which means that as the trip distance increases, the fare amount also tends to increase.\n4. The median passenger_count is 1 (most trips have only 1 passenger), and no strong difference in average fare amounts among different passenger counts is observed.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. When developing a predictive model for estimating future fares, consider trip_distance as one of the most significant predictors of fare_amount, due to the strong positive correlation found in our dataset.\n2. Additional features, such as time of day, day of the week, or geographic region, could be incorporated into the model to further improve its accuracy; however, these were not analyzed in the dataset this time.\n3. Make sure to preprocess the dataset (removing outliers and unreasonable values) before using it for model training and testing, as this will ensure that the model is based on accurate and representative data.\n4. Consider testing multiple machine learning algorithms (such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks) to find the model with the best performance in predicting fares."

The average fare per kilometer is around $29.94.\n4. The busiest hour for pickups is 7 PM (19:00), with 617 total pickups in the dataset.\n5. The busiest day for pickups is Thursday, with 1476 total pickups in the dataset.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on providing rides during evenings, especially around 7 PM since that is the busiest hour for pickups.\n2. Expect increased demand for rides on Thursdays, so try to be more available for passengers during that day of the week.\n3. Since the average fare per kilometer is about $29.94, you can use this as a benchmark to compare with your fare per kilometer to evaluate your performance.\n4. Since most rides have 1-2 passengers on average, consider optimizing your vehicle for comfort and space for 1-2 passengers.\n5. Keep track of locations where you get higher-than-average fares per kilometer and try to prioritize pickups from those areas to potentially increase your income."

The average opening and closing prices for the IBM stock over the last two years were around 118.75 and 118.73 respectively, with a standard deviation of around 11 points.\n2. The average daily trading volume was 236,961, with a median of 187,490 and a considerably high standard deviation of 177,743, indicating significant variability in trading volume.\n3. The historical daily stock returns had a small positive mean of 0.0007, a standard deviation of 0.0153, and a negative correlation with volume (-0.0909), suggesting that on average, the stock had slightly positive returns with small daily fluctuations.\n4. A rolling window analysis (20-day window) of the stock returns revealed a variable trend and volatility over time, meaning that the stock performance may not have been consistent throughout the period.\n5. A simple linear regression model trained on historical data to predict stock price movements achieved a mean squared error of 3.509135 and an R-squared value of 0.968356, indicating a relatively good performance in predicting future stock prices.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Considering the historical positive average returns, investing in IBM stock may potentially result in positive returns in the short term.\n2. Although the linear regression model showed good performance in predicting future stock prices, it is important to be cautious when using a single time-series model for investment purposes, as stock market behavior can be quite complex and unpredictable.\n3. It is recommended to further develop, test, and compare other forecasting models such as ARIMA, GARCH, or even deep learning models like LSTM to better understand and predict stock price movements.\n4. In addition to historical data, consider incorporating other factors such as market news, macroeconomic indicators, and industry data to improve the forecasting model and provide a more comprehensive analysis for decision-making.\n5. Diversify your portfolio by investing in other stocks or assets to minimize the impact of potential losses from unexpected events or sudden declines of a single stock."

The standard deviations of daily, weekly, and monthly price changes are 1.271%, 3.227%, and 6.167%, respectively, indicating the level of volatility in the stock prices.\n3. Periods with high price volatility were identified, and it's suggested to examine possible reasons for these periods (e.g., news and events) in order to understand potential risks in IBM stocks.\n4. Periods with significantly high trading volumes were also identified, which may indicate increased investor interest during those periods, and again, it's suggested to examine the reasons behind these high trading volumes.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider the average positive price movement as an indicator of potential growth in the stock. However, do not solely rely on historical performance for making investment decisions.\n2. Investigate the reasons behind periods with high price volatility and high trading volumes to better understand the risks associated with investing in IBM stocks.\n3. Assess the overall market conditions and other factors such as company performance, industry trends, and competitors to make a more comprehensive decision on investing in IBM stocks.\n4.

The annualized volatility, which is a measure of risk, is 24.2578%. This shows that the stock's price movements can be quite significant.\n3. The rolling 30-day average price of IBM stock increased from around $104 to $134 during the past two years, suggesting a general upward price trend.\n4. The rolling 30-day average trading volume has fluctuated between approximately 121,000 and 414,000 shares, indicating varying levels of investor interest and trading activity.\n5. The average rolling 30-day Sharpe ratio, which measures risk-adjusted return, is 0.04. Higher Sharpe ratios indicate better performance adjusted for risk.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Given the positive average daily return and upward price trend, continuing to hold IBM stock might be a reasonable decision if you are satisfied with the performance and risk levels.\n2. If you are concerned about the stock's volatility, you might consider diversifying your portfolio to include other stocks or investment options to minimize risk.\n3. Monitor the rolling 30-day Sharpe ratio to gauge the stock's risk-adjusted performance. If the Sharpe ratio consistently becomes negative or significantly lower, it may be an indication to reconsider your investment in IBM.\n4. Keep an eye on the trading volume to identify any sudden changes that might be a signal of a shift in market sentiment or potential news affecting IBM's business outlook.\n5. As always, consult with a financial advisor to ensure that your investment decisions are aligned with your personal goals and risk tolerance."

The average daily trading volume is 11,425.91 shares, with a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 745,925 shares.\n3. The average daily price movement (difference between high and low prices) is 0.08, while the largest daily movement reached $5.45.\n4. With the average daily return close to 0%, IBM stock exhibits stability in daily price changes.\n5. Volatility analysis shows that the stock's price and volume fluctuations vary depending on the observation period: the longer the observation period, the higher the volatility.\n6. There is a slightly negative correlation (-0.05) between stock prices (open, high, low, close) and volume, indicating that as prices increase, volume tends to slightly decrease, and vice versa.\n7. Moving averages of stock prices and volume show that the stock has experienced different trends at different periods, ranging from a 7-day to 90-day observation.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider monitoring price movements and moving averages closely to identify trends and inform decisions on buying, holding, or selling the stock.\n2. Pay attention to the volume and price correlation for potential market inefficiencies in periods of high volume and low prices or vice versa. Take advantage of buying opportunities during periods of low prices and high trading volumes.\n3. Due to the stock's stability in daily price changes, it can be considered a relatively safe long-term investment. However, it's essential to monitor the company's financial performance and market trends to ensure its ongoing stability.\n4. Regularly review the stock's volatilities across different time frames to better understand the overall risk associated with the investment.\n5. While the provided data offers insight into the stock's historical performance, consider other external factors such as the company's financial statements, market trends, news, and competitors to make more informed decisions about the future direction and strategy of the company."

There are 18 distinct Pokemon types in the dataset, with Water being the most common (123 Pokemon), followed by Normal (109 Pokemon), and Grass (86 Pokemon).\n3. The top 3 Pokemon types with the highest total stats on average are Dragon, Steel, and Psychic.\n4. The top 10 individual Pokemon with the highest total stats are Arceus, Eternatus, Palkia, Yveltal, Ho-oh, Rayquaza, Lugia, Zekrom, Reshiram, and Lunala.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on promoting Pokemon from the three most common types (Water, Normal, and Grass) as they have a larger base of potential fans due to their frequency in the dataset.\n2. Consider selecting and promoting Pokemon from the Dragon, Steel, and Psychic types, as they have the highest average total stats and may be considered powerful and appealing by the audience.\n3. Choose some of the top 10 individual Pokemon with the highest total stats (e.g., Arceus, Eternatus, Palkia, etc.) for promotional campaigns, as their high stats may make them popular and attractive to fans.\n4. Conduct additional research or surveys to gauge the popularity of specific Pokemon among the target audience, as this analysis focuses on type frequency and average total stats, but there may be other factors influencing popularity that are not captured in the dataset."

The weakest types of Pokemon on average are bug, normal, and grass types.\n3. Arceus has the highest combined total stats, and Wishiwashi-solo has the lowest combined total stats.\n4. Strongest positive correlations are between total_stats and sp_atk, total_stats and attack, and total_stats and sp_def.\n5. The strongest negative correlation is minimal between defense and speed.\n6. Water, normal, and grass types are the most common Pokemon types in the dataset, while flying, fairy, and ice types are the least common.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on using dragon, steel, and psychic-type Pokemon as they generally have higher combined stats on average.\n2. Avoid using bug, normal, and grass-type Pokemon as they typically have lower combined stats on average.\n3. Include Arceus in your team as it has the highest combined total stats in the dataset.\n4. Consider prioritizing Pokemon with high stats in sp_atk, attack, and sp_def, as they contribute the most to the overall combined stats.\n5. Be cautious about using water, normal, and grass types in your team, as opponents may have strategies to counter the most common types of Pokemon.\n6. You may consider using flying, fairy, and ice types as they are less common, and your opponents may be less prepared to face them."

Each Pok\u00e9mon type has distinct attribute characteristics, with some types being stronger or faster on average.\n3. The attributes of Pok\u00e9mon evolve at different rates depending on their type, and generally, all attributes improve over the course of evolution.\n4. The average attribute differences observed in evolutions are as follows: height (5.83), weight (419.33), hp (18.17), attack (16.67), defense (17.33), sp atk (19.83), sp def (18.50), and speed (17.50).\n5. Analyzing the top 10 highest and bottom 10 lowest Pok\u00e9mon for each attribute, distinct trends become apparent, reflecting the attributes for which those species excel in or are not as strong.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on studying specific types of Pok\u00e9mon to understand their evolution patterns better, since types differ in their attributes.\n2. Investigate the factors that contribute to considerable differences in Pok\u00e9mon attributes, such as regions, environments, or the type of moves learnt.\n3. For a more in-depth evolution pattern analysis, consider preparing a list of Pok\u00e9mon based on their evolution stage, e.g., base Pok\u00e9mon, 1st evolution, 2nd evolution.\n4. Analyze stat growth ratios and move combinations as Pok\u00e9mon evolve to provide a richer understanding of how species' battling capabilities change over time.\n5. Utilize clustering or other advanced statistical methods on the dataset to uncover potential groups or patterns between Pok\u00e9mon evolutions beyond just their types and attributes."

Consider creating merchandise featuring the top 10 iconic Pokemon identified through their high total base stat values. These Pokemon are popular and recognizable, likely boosting the interest in your merchandise.\n3. Alternatively, you could focus on a mix of popular types and iconic Pokemon to cater to diverse fan interests and preferences, enhancing the appeal of your merchandise. For example, choose 2-3 Pokemon from each of the most common types and 5-6 from the top 10 iconic Pokemon based on total base stats."

Other common types across generations include Normal, Grass, Bug, Fire, Electric, Poison, and Psychic, but their distribution varies significantly across different generations.\n4. Some types, such as Fairy and Dark, have a more uneven distribution across generations, with certain generations having a higher concentration of these types.\n5. The type distribution varies noticeably between generations, with no single type dominating consistently across all generations.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. In order to have a more balanced representation of Pokemon types, consider analyzing each generation separately to ensure the inclusion of various types from different generations.\n2. If you aim to focus on specific types, consider selecting certain generations that have a higher concentration of your desired types, such as Generation 6 for Fairy type or Generation 5 for Bug type.\n3. For a comprehensive understanding of the distribution trends of each type, consider studying the factors that contribute to the type distribution shifts between generations.\n4. The dataset currently being used only contains basic information about Pokemon. For further analysis, consider incorporating additional data, such as regional information or abilities, to gain more insights into the reasons behind the type distribution changes across generations."

'Fighting' and 'Dragon' types have the highest average 'attack' values, while 'Steel' and 'Rock' types have the highest average 'defense' values.\n3. The top 5 Pokemon with the highest 'attack' are Kartana (Grass), Rampardos (Rock), Slaking (Normal), Regigigas (Normal), and Groudon (Ground).\n4. The top 5 Pokemon with the highest 'defense' are Shuckle (Bug), Stakataka (Rock), Steelix (Steel), Regirock (Rock), and Avalugg (Ice).\n5. There is a moderate correlation between 'attack' and 'defense' (0.45), indicating that strong Pokemon in one aspect do not necessarily excel in the other aspect. 'Speed' has a low correlation with 'defense' (-0.01), suggesting that fast Pokemon might not have high defense values.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider focusing on Pokemon with 'Fighting', 'Dragon', 'Steel', and 'Rock' types, as they tend to have higher attack or defense values.\n2. When choosing Pokemon for the team, balance between 'attack' and 'defense': strong attackers could suffer from weaker defenses and vice versa, as seen by the correlation results.\n3. Pay attention to 'speed' when choosing Pokemon: fast Pokemon might have lower defense stats, so consider pairing them with high-defense Pokemon for strategic advantage.\n4. Use the `display_pokemon_by_type()` function to explore potential team members for specific types, taking into account their 'hp', 'attack', 'defense', 'sp atk', 'sp def', and 'speed' values for effective battle tactics."

Organize competitions or events focusing on specific attributes or categories, such as the fastest-Mon competition (covering speed) or the highest-HP contest (based on the hp attribute).\n2. Consider organizing tournaments based on Pokemon types, such as separate contests for the three most common types (water, normal, and grass) or a tournament combining different types.\n3. Plan events challenging the participants to use less-common Pokemon types like fairy, ice, or flying, which could bring diversity and encourage participants to explore and strategize using different combinations.\n4. Organize events based on the highest-ranking types in each attribute (e.g., tournaments involving only Psychic and Electric types for participants keen on high Sp Atk).\n5. To attract participation, incorporate a variety in the events, such as mixing speed-based events with battles focusing on strategic play (using a combination of attack, defense, and special attacks)."

We primarily focused on specific characteristics such as being good with children, trainability, energy level, and protectiveness.\n3. Based on our filtering criteria (good_with_children >= 4, trainability >= 4, energy >= 3, and protectiveness >= 4), we identified 12 breeds that meet these requirements.\n4. The filtered breeds vary in size, with the Boerboel being the largest (max weight 200 lbs) and the Yorkshire Terrier being the smallest (max weight 7 lbs).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider the size of the dogs you want to breed, and narrow down the list based on your preference for larger or smaller breeds.\n2. If you want a breed that excels in all the specific characteristics (good_with_children, trainability, energy, and protectiveness scores of 5), the Doberman Pinscher and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier are excellent options.\n3. If you prefer a less energetic breed that still meets the other criteria, the Boerboel, Chinook, and Hovawart have energy scores of 3.\n4. Consult with other breeders or experts for additional information and guidance before making a final decision based on other factors such as your existing breeds, breeding facilities, or market demand."

The top 10 trainable breeds include Golden Retriever, Mudi, Doberman Pinscher, Field Spaniel, Giant Schnauzer, Treeing Walker Coonhound, Keeshond, American Hairless Terrier, American Water Spaniel, and Shetland Sheepdog.\n2. The average trainability score across all breeds is 3.80.\n3. There are 61 breeds with trainability scores above the average, while 22 breeds have their trainability scores below the average.\n4. Some attributes have a positive correlation with trainability, such as playfulness, good with children, good with strangers, energy, and good with other dogs. This means that breeds with higher trainability tend to have these attributes as well.\n5. Some attributes have a negative correlation with trainability, such as height and weight of the dogs. This means that breeds with higher trainability tend to have lower values in these attributes.\n6. There are 37 breeds with high trainability and high energy level, which may be suitable for high intensity training programs.\n7. There are 23 breeds with high trainability and low shedding level, which may be suitable for indoor training programs or for clients with allergy concerns.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider selecting breeds from the top 10 trainable breeds or those with above-average trainability scores based on the specific training program requirements.\n2. For high-intensity training programs, consider focusing on breeds that have high trainability and high energy level, such as the Labrador Retriever, Border Collie, or Treeing Walker Coonhound.\n3. For indoor or allergy-sensitive training programs, consider choosing breeds with high trainability and low shedding level, such as the Poodle (Miniature), American Hairless Terrier, or Bichon Frise.\n4. Take into account the positive correlations between trainability and other attributes to help in selecting a breed that is not only trainable but also a good fit for clients' lifestyle and needs.\n5. Since size (height and weight) has a negative correlation with trainability, consider smaller breeds for training programs where trainability is a paramount factor."

The median life expectancy is also around the same range, at 12-14 years.\n2. Most of the dog breeds in our dataset have a coat length of category 1. Only three breeds have a coat length of category 2, and one breed has a coat length of category 0.\n3. The distribution of dog breeds in terms of being good with children and good with other dogs shows that most breeds tend to be moderately good (category 3). A good number of breeds are also excellent in both categories (category 5).\n4. The top 10 dog breeds for dog shows, based on a combination of good_with_children, good_with_other_dogs, trainability, and playfulness are, in no particular order: Labrador Retriever, Keeshond, Shetland Sheepdog, Golden Retriever, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Havanese, Treeing Walker Coonhound, Irish Setter, Vizsla, and Bernese Mountain Dog.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Use the top 10 dog breeds identified above as a starting point for evaluating physical attributes and breed standards at the dog show.\n2. Focus on breeds with a higher coat length category (1 and 2) as they are more common in our dataset and may better represent a wider range of breeds.\n3. If judging dogs on their sociability (with children and other dogs), consider breeds that scored well in good_with_children and good_with_other_dogs categories.\n4. Explore other factors that might contribute to identifying top dog breeds for dog shows if needed, such as protectiveness, energy level, or barking tendencies."

        "content": "## Final report\n### Findings\n1. Good_with_children, good_with_other_dogs, and good_with_strangers are positively correlated, meaning that dog breeds that are good with children also tend to be good with other dogs and strangers.\n2. Playfulness is highly correlated with good_with_strangers, indicating that playful dog breeds tend to be more friendly towards strangers.\n3. Energy is moderately correlated with playfulness, suggesting that active dog breeds tend to be more playful.\n4. Protective breeds do not show a strong correlation with other temperament traits.\n5. Breeds with high trainability tend to be friendly towards children, other dogs, strangers, and are generally more playful.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. For families with children, consider friendly breeds such as the Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, or Boxer for their high scores in being good with children, other dogs, and strangers.\n2. If a dog owner prefers a playful breed, a Labrador Retriever, Poodle (Miniature), or Border Collie would be a good option due to their high scores in playfulness, friendliness towards strangers, and trainability.\n3. For those seeking protective breeds with a lower correlation to other temperament traits, consider options like the Great Dane, Bullmastiff, or Chow Chow.\n4. If low energy and low barking are priorities, consider breeds like the Golden Retriever, Bullmastiff, or Chow Chow as they score low in both energy and barking levels.\n5. For owners who value a highly trainable dog, consider breeds such as the Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Poodle (Miniature), or German Longhaired Pointer due to their top scores in trainability."

The average number of subscribers, video views, and video count for channels in our database indicates that Shows, Nonprofits & Activism, and News & Politics categories tend to have higher values in these metrics.\n2. Top YouTube channels based on subscribers, video views, and video count include popular channels like T-Series, Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes, SET India, PewDiePie, and WWE.\n3. The correlation between subscribers and video views is strong (0.79), which suggests that channels with more subscribers tend to have more video views. The correlation between the number of subscribers and the year the channel started is negative (-0.13), indicating that older channels tend to have more subscribers on average.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on categories with high average subscribers, video views, and video count, such as Shows, Nonprofits & Activism, and News & Politics for running ad campaigns, as these categories are more likely to have better engagement and reach.\n2. Consider popular channels with a high number of subscribers and video views, such as T-Series, Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes, SET India, and WWE, for ad placement. However, the target audience of these channels should be aligned with the brand's target market.\n3. It could be beneficial to explore older channels that have consistently amassed subscribers and views over time, as they may have a more loyal and engaged audience."

The most popular categories in terms of the number of channels are Entertainment (241), Music (222), People & Blogs (119), and Gaming (102).\n3. The average age of the channels in the dataset is around 9.73 years, with the youngest channels being 1 year old and the oldest being 52 years old.\n4. The channels with the highest engagement (video views per subscriber) are music, children's content, news, and pets & animals channels.\n5. The channels with the highest activity (video count per subscriber) are news channels, TV shows, and other informative channels like Science & Technology and Education.\n6. There is a positive correlation between a channel's age and factors such as subscribers, video count, video views, and video views per subscriber. However, the correlation values are not very strong, so this relationship is not highly significant.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on categories with higher engagement levels such as Music, Children's content, News, and Pets & Animals, as they tend to have more video views per subscriber.\n2. Channel activity can be another important factor when deciding on channels to analyze. Consider looking more into News, TV Shows, Science & Technology, and Education channels for higher activity levels.\n3. While a positive correlation exists between a channel's age and its number of subscribers, video views, and engagement, it's not strong enough to rely solely on it for decision making. Consider looking at other parameters as well to have a holistic view of the channels' performance.\n4. For a more comprehensive analysis, consider incorporating other factors such as social media engagement (likes, comments, shares) or viewership retention, which could provide additional insights into the audience's behavior and the content's success."

The average number of subscribers for the most subscribed YouTube channels is around 20.37 million, with a median of 15.5 million and a standard deviation of 15.39 million, showing a wide range in the number of subscribers.\n\n2. The mean video views are about 9.31 billion, with a median of 6.17 billion and a standard deviation of 12.18 billion, which implies that video views also have a broad distribution.\n\n3. The average number of videos uploaded is 8,776, with a wide variation (standard deviation of 29,733) and a median of 899 videos, which means some channels have significantly more videos than others.\n\n4. The most popular categories are Entertainment, Music, People & Blogs, and Gaming, with more than 100 channels in each category.\n\n5. The analysis shows that most channels were started between 2011 and 2015, with a decreasing trend in the number of new channels started per year after 2015.\n\n6. There is a strong positive correlation (0.79) between the number of subscribers and video views, indicating that channels with more subscribers typically have more views.\n\n7. The correlations between video count, year started, and subscribers/video views are relatively weak, highlighting that these factors may not have a significant influence on a channel's success.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on promoting and supporting channels in the most popular categories (Entertainment, Music, People & Blogs, and Gaming) to increase user engagement and satisfaction.\n\n2. Encourage channels to increase their subscriber base since channels with more subscribers tend to have more video views, resulting in a higher user activity and increased watch time.\n\n3. Investigate and identify best practices and strategies employed by channels with a high subscriber-to-view ratio, and educate content creators to implement these practices and boost their views and user engagement.\n\n4. To counteract the decreasing trend in new channels since 2015, focus on nurturing emerging content and creators in popular categories. Provide resources, training, and support to help new channels grow and succeed on the platform.\n\n5. Consider additional factors not covered by this analysis, such as audience demographics, content quality, and viewer's watch time, which might provide more insights into how to improve the user experience further."

The average number of subscribers for the most subscribed YouTube channels is 20,372,428, with a median of 15,500,000 and a standard deviation of 15,394,899.\n2. The average video views for these channels are 9,310,090,988, with a median of 6,165,843,386 and a standard deviation of 12,189,942,672.\n3. The average video count for these channels is 8,785, with a median of 896 and a standard deviation of 29,747.\n4. The channels were mostly started around 2012 (mean starting year), with a standard deviation of 4 years.\n5. The top 5 categories with the most channels are Entertainment (240 channels), Music (222 channels), People & Blogs (119 channels), Gaming (102 channels), and Comedy (63 channels).\n6. The top 10 channels with the highest average views per video include well-known artists such as Michael Jackson, Adele, and Chris Brown, with average views ranging from 325 million to 1.8 billion.\n7. There is a positive correlation of 0.79 between subscribers and video views, indicating that channels with more subscribers generally have more video views.\n8. The growth of channels over time shows an increase in average subscribers, video views, and video count for each starting year, with a peak around 2016 and a slight decrease in recent years (2019-2021).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on acquiring or developing content in the top categories, such as Entertainment, Music, People & Blogs, and Gaming, since they have a large audience and potential for high subscriber growth.\n2. Consider collaborating with or investing in channels with high average views per video, as they have demonstrated a strong audience appeal and high engagement.\n3. Monitor channels with the highest and lowest views per subscriber, as these channels could potentially represent unique content niches that can drive engagement and attract audiences to your platform.\n4. Keep an eye on channels started in recent years, as they may represent emerging trends and opportunities in the entertainment industry.\n5. Research and analyze additional factors that may contribute to the success of YouTube channels, such as video length, production quality, and target audience, to make a more informed decision on content acquisition and development."

The average case duration metric is not useful, as all durations are 0, indicating possible data issues.\n5.

Phone is the most common channel for cases, handling both signup and support cases, while email is only used for support cases.\n7. The 6-month retention rate is 90.85% for Product 1 and 82.14% for Product 2. The 12-month retention rate is 76.26% for Product 1 and 54.23% for Product 2.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the data issues related to case duration and consider addressing this metric once the data is corrected.\n2. Focus on improving the support experience, as it is the main reason for customer contact. This can be done by providing better training for support staff or improving user documentation.\n3. Explore offering more diverse product pricing options to engage a wider array of customers, especially younger customers or those with different preferences.\n4. Since phone is the preferred channel for customers, consider improving phone support by increasing the number of agents, reducing waiting times, or offering callback support.\n5. Aim to improve the retention rate of Product 2 (monthly_subscription) by analyzing the reasons for churn and implementing better customer engagement strategies.\n6. Continually monitor and analyze customer data to understand customer behavior and preferences, which can help drive effective product development and pricing strategies in the future."

The majority of customers reaching out to customer support are for support-related issues (60.47%), while 39.53% contact due to signing up for the service.\n5. Both male and female customers show a similar preference for the annual product (prd_1) over the monthly product (prd_2).\n6. Across different age groups, customers generally prefer the annual product (prd_1) over the monthly product (prd_2).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus marketing efforts on attracting customers in the 57-64 age range, as they represent the majority of the current customer base.\n2. Put more emphasis on promoting the annual product (prd_1), as it is the preferred choice for the majority of customers across all demographics.\n3. Enhance customer support for signup-related issues, since it is one of the main reasons for contacting customer support.\n4. Develop tailored marketing campaigns targeting each gender, as there is a higher proportion of male customers.\n5. Explore options to improve the monthly product (prd_2) or introduce new pricing schemes to attract a wider range of customers."

The majority of your customers are subscribed to the annual subscription (prd_1) with 6,500 subscribers, while the monthly subscription (prd_2) has 3,679 subscribers.\n2. Total monthly revenue generated from the annual subscription is 7,800,000 units, and from the monthly subscription is 459,875 units.\n3. The average age of your customers is around 58 years old, with a fairly equal distribution between customers aged 35-65 years and those aged 65+ years.\n4. The gender distribution of your customers is 60% male and 40% female.\n5. Product preferences differ by gender, with more males (3929) preferring the annual subscription (prd_1), and more females (2571) also preferring the annual subscription over the monthly option (prd_2).\n6. The most common reason for customer support cases is 'support' (60%), while 40% of the cases are for 'signup'.\n7. The preferred channel for customers to contact support is predominantly phone (87%), with only 12% of customers using email.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As the annual subscription (prd_1) accounts for a significant proportion of subscribers and revenue, focus marketing and promotional efforts on promoting this product, emphasizing its benefits compared to the monthly subscription.\n2. Given the older age demographics of your customers and their subscription preferences, consider tailoring marketing campaigns towards this age group with appropriate messaging and channels.\n3. Explore initiatives to increase the number of female subscribers, by better understanding their preferences and potential barriers to signing up for the annual subscription.\n4. To address the most common support cases, create targeted resources (FAQs, help articles, live chat, informative videos) to assist customers with 'support' needs, which may reduce the support request volume.\n5. Since phone support is the preferred channel for customers, ensure you have a well-trained and responsive phone support team, and explore opportunities for phone support optimization like call routing, callback options, and IVR updates.\n6. Monitor support case trends and customer feedback continuously, to identify further opportunities for improvements to the support process and the overall customer experience."

There is a higher percentage of male customers (60.04%) than female customers (39.96%).\n3. The age distribution reveals that the majority of customers are between 50 and 60 years old.\n4. New customer signups by product and gender show mixed trends, and it is not possible to determine a definite trend or pattern from the given data.\n5. It is not possible to calculate the churn rate as the existing data does not offer a complete view of customer churn.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To better understand customer subscription trends, additional data should be collected, such as customers' preferences, location, and marketing campaign performance.\n2. Analyze customer feedback or surveys to identify areas for improvement and check if there is any correlation between customer satisfaction and the type of subscription plan.\n3. Focus marketing efforts on the 50 to 60 age group, as they represent the majority of current customers, but also consider targeting other age groups to attract a more diverse customer base.\n4. Measure and monitor churn rates accurately by updating the dataset to include customers' subscription statuses, which would help identify the reasons behind the churn and enable the implementation of effective retention strategies.\n5. Explore the idea of introducing more subscription plans or promotional offers to attract and retain customers based on their preferences and needs."

The pollutant with the highest average air quality value is 'Total hydrocarbons', followed by 'Elapsed Sample Time' and 'Barometric pressure'.\n2. California and Texas have the highest average pollutant levels for 'Total hydrocarbons', with California having significantly higher levels than any other state.\n3. In California, the top 5 pollutants with the highest average levels are 'Total hydrocarbons', 'Elapsed Sample Time', 'Barometric pressure', 'Sample Min Baro Pressure', and 'Sample Max Baro Pressure'.\n4. The air quality value for 'Total hydrocarbons' has shown a fluctuating trend, with 1981 having the lowest value, 1990 having the highest value, and a slight increase observed in 1995.\n5. Texas has the highest number of monitoring stations, followed by California, Ohio, New York, and Minnesota.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Implement stricter regulations and monitoring on hydrocarbon emissions, especially in California and Texas, where the levels are significantly higher.\n2. Encourage the use of cleaner energy sources and promote the reduction of hydrocarbon emissions across all states.\n3. Review and enhance the calibration, measurement, and maintenance procedures of monitoring stations to ensure accurate results.\n4. Increase the number of monitoring stations in states with fewer stations to improve the reliability and geographic coverage of air quality data.\n5. Conduct further analysis on other factors contributing to higher pollutant levels in certain states and design targeted policies to address these factors."

Locations with the highest concentration of the top 10 pollutants were analyzed, which include cities like Escondido, New Haven, and Birmingham.\n3. The trends of the concentrations of these pollutants were examined over the years, helping to understand their distribution and fluctuations.\n4. Some pollutants, such as 'Elapsed Sample Time' and various atmospheric pressure-related measurements, were not directly related to pollution and hence might not need specific control measures.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. For locations with the highest concentration of 'Total hydrocarbons', implement strict emissions regulations for industrial facilities and invest in cleaner fuels and alternate energy sources to reduce pollution.\n2. Establish air quality monitoring programs in cities that have higher concentrations of pollutants such as 'Sodium PM10 LC' and 'Naphthalene (TSP) STP' to track pollutant levels and assess the effectiveness of pollution reduction measures.\n3. Encourage the adoption of cleaner production processes and technologies by industrial companies, especially those located in highly polluted areas, to minimize emissions and reduce environmental impact.\n4. Promote public awareness and involvement in pollution reduction practices, like the proper disposal of waste materials responsible for pollutant emissions, and supporting environment-friendly products and companies.\n5. Collaborate with stakeholders such as local authorities, environmental agencies, and NGOs to develop and implement effective pollution control measures, targeting the high-polluting substances and locations identified in the analysis."

The average company rating does not seem to have a significant correlation with company size: small companies (0 employees) have a rating of 3.95, medium-sized companies (500-1,000 employees) have ratings around 3.90, and the largest companies (10,000+ employees) have a rating of 3.85.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on industries with high employee satisfaction levels when considering potential companies for collaboration or employee recruitment, such as Membership Organizations, Colleges & Universities, and Staffing & Subcontracting.\n2. Although large companies (10,000+ employees) might provide more financial stability or resources, they might have slightly lower employee satisfaction levels. Prioritize smaller or medium-sized companies that have a better balance between financial stability and employee satisfaction levels.\n3.

The average company rating in the dataset is 3.89, with a median rating of 3.90, which suggests that most companies have similar overall ratings.\n2. Health Care Services & Hospitals, Colleges & Universities, Information Technology Support Services, Enterprise Software & Network Solutions, and Computer Hardware Development are the top industries in terms of the number of companies in the dataset.\n3. There is no strong correlation between ratings, reviews, and salaries, which implies that high-rated companies don't necessarily have a higher number of reviews or salaries.\n4. The top two industries with the highest average company ratings are private households and membership organizations.\n5. The highest-rated company, Radio Flyer, focuses on toy and hobby stores, and has a high Composite Score considering multiple factors such as rating, reviews, and industry health.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Clients looking for potential partnerships or acquisitions should consider companies with high Composite Scores, as they reflect strong performance considering multiple factors.\n2. Companies operating in industries with higher industry health should be considered for partnerships or acquisitions since they have a stronger overall performance and reputation.\n3. Regions with higher average ratings, such as the cities listed in the \"Top 5 Cities with the Highest Average Company Ratings\", can be targeted for potential investment and expansion, as they tend to have successful businesses.\n4. When identifying potential partnerships or acquisitions, the number of reviews should not be the sole factor, as it does not necessarily correlate with a company's rating or industry health.\n5. Consider the top 10 performing companies provided in the output as potential targets for partnerships or acquisitions, focusing on the industry type and overall composite score that aligns with the client's strategic goals."

Colleges & Universities is the highest-rated industry with an average rating of 4.05, while Health Care Services & Hospitals is the lowest-rated with an average rating of 3.81.\n2. Company ratings have a weak negative correlation with the number of employees, suggesting that larger companies might have slightly lower ratings.\n3. Geographic concentration for companies in the highest and lowest-rated industries is primarily in the United States, with some companies having multiple office locations across the country.\n4. University of San Francisco is the top employer in the Colleges & Universities industry in terms of job postings, while Hoag Memorial Hospital is the leading employer in the Health Care Services & Hospitals industry.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Encourage policy initiatives to support the growth and development of the Colleges & Universities industry, as it has the highest ratings and generates numerous job opportunities.\n2. Investigate ways to enhance employee satisfaction in large companies, as there's a weak negative correlation between company ratings and the number of employees.\n3. Focus on regions with the highest concentration of companies in both the highest and lowest-rated industries for the most significant impact and target policies that address regional needs.\n4. Look into partnerships with employers like University of San Francisco and Hoag Memorial Hospital to gain insights into their successful practices and share those with other companies in the respective industries."

The Muslim population is projected to experience the most significant growth from 2010 to 2050, with an increase of 1,161,780,000 people worldwide.\n2. The Christian population is expected to grow by 749,740,000 people in the same period, making it the religion with the second-highest growth.\n3. The Unaffiliated population is projected to increase by 99,190,000 people during this time frame.\n4. The Hindu population is expected to experience growth as well, with an increase of 352,150,000 people.\n5. The Buddhist population, on the other hand, is projected to decrease by 1,490,000 people from 2010 to 2050.\n6. Asia-Pacific will experience the most significant changes in population across various religious groups, with the Muslim population increasing and the Unaffiliated population decreasing.\n7. Europe and North America are expected to have an increase in the Muslim and Unaffiliated populations and a decrease in the Christian population.\n8. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to experience substantial growth in both the Christian and Muslim populations.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate more resources to regions experiencing significant population growth, such as Asia-Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa, to accommodate the needs of the growing religious communities.\n2. Focus on addressing the needs of the rapidly growing Muslim population across all regions, as well as the Christian population in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America-Caribbean.\n3. Consider the changing demographics in Europe and North America, where the Christian population is projected to decrease, and the Muslim and Unaffiliated populations are expected to increase. Adjust social services, education, and community outreach to better serve these changing communities.\n4. Monitor the decrease in the Buddhist population and ensure that their needs are still met despite the declining numbers.\n5. Regularly review demographic trends and adjust resource allocation accordingly to ensure the everchanging needs of various religious communities are met.\n6. Foster interfaith dialogue and cooperation to ensure social harmony in the face of demographic changes, especially in regions with significant growth in multiple religious communities.\n7. Support research and collect updated demographic data regularly to ensure that the most accurate and up-to-date information is used for decision-making and resource allocation."

The religious groups with the highest growth in several countries are Christians in Sub-Saharan Africa, Muslims in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa, and Unaffiliated in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia-Pacific.\n2. There is a significant decline in a few religious groups' populations in certain countries, such as Christians in Middle East-North Africa and Europe, Muslims in Europe, and Jews in Europe.\n3. The religious groups with high growth rates in various regions could be potential target markets for your business expansion.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa for marketing campaigns and product offerings related to Christianity, as this region has shown significant growth potential in this religious group.\n2. Expand your marketing and product offerings in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa to attract the growing Muslim community.\n3. Develop marketing campaigns and product offerings aimed at the Unaffiliated religious group in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia-Pacific, as there is a notable growth trend in these regions.\n4. Reevaluate or limit marketing campaigns and product offerings in regions and countries where specific religious groups are shrinking, such as Christians and Jews in Europe and the Middle East-North Africa.\n5. Keep track of global demographic trends and adjust your marketing strategies accordingly, ensuring that your business remains aligned with the evolving religious landscape."

The proportion of different religions varies widely across different regions, with certain religions dominating specific areas (e.g., Christians in Latin America-Caribbean, Muslims in the Middle East-North Africa).\n2. Between 2010 and 2050, the Muslim population is projected to experience the fastest growth in most regions, including the World, Asia-Pacific, North America, and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n3. The fastest-declining religion for each region varies, with Buddhists declining the fastest in the World and Asia-Pacific, Christians in Europe, Hindus in Latin America-Caribbean, Other Religions in the Middle East-North Africa, and Jews in North America and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n4. Regions with the highest diversity of religious growth rates (i.e., the largest difference between the fastest-growing and fastest-declining religions) include Europe, Latin America-Caribbean, and North America.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on regions with the highest diversity of religious growth rates, such as Europe, Latin America-Caribbean, and North America, as promoting interfaith understanding is especially critical in areas with numerous and varying religious populations.\n2. In regions where Muslims are the fastest-growing religion, consider supporting local organizations or initiatives fostering dialogue, cooperation, and understanding among Muslims and other religious communities.\n3. In areas where specific religions are declining rapidly, encourage projects that help prevent the further marginalization of minority religious groups by promoting inclusivity and respect for these populations.\n4. Target philanthropic efforts towards local grassroots initiatives that create spaces and programs for interfaith dialogue and collaboration, as these organizations often have a better understanding of the unique cultural and religious landscape of their communities.\n5. Finally, look for opportunities to support educational programs and projects that encourage interfaith understanding and respect from a young age, as this can have a lasting impact on fostering tolerance and cooperation among different religious populations."

The total religious populations in each region for both 2010 and 2050 were calculated, showing that the number of adherents to major religious groups is expected to grow in most regions.\n3. Top 5 countries with the highest percentage of each religious group in both 2010 and 2050 were identified, which could be potential hotspots for religious discrimination or violence.\n4. The growth rate of each religious group was calculated for each region, and it was found that some regions have significant growth or decline in specific religious groups between 2010 and 2050, which may represent potential areas for conflict or tension due to religious changes.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize monitoring of countries with the highest percentage of each religious group, as these countries may be of special interest for addressing religious discrimination, persecution, or violence.\n2. Keep an eye on regions with significant growth or decline in specific religious groups' populations, as these changes might lead to tension and conflict in those regions.\n3. Establish contacts and communication channels with local organizations working on religious rights and interfaith dialogues in the identified countries and regions to gather real-time information and insights on the current situation.\n4. Create tailored initiatives and programs to address the specific issues and challenges in each region, ensuring that they take into account the unique religious and cultural contexts.\n5. Regularly update the analysis with new data as it becomes available to monitor the ongoing trends and identify new areas of concern or potential opportunities for positive engagement."

The dataset consists of 768 patients with 9 variables: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and Outcome (diabetes status).\n2. There is no missing data, but some variables (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI) initially contained biologically implausible zero values. These values were replaced with mean/median values as appropriate.\n3. Approximately 34.9% of patients in the dataset have diabetes, and 65.1% do not have diabetes.\n4. Glucose levels, BMI, and Age showed the strongest correlation with diabetes outcome.\n5. Logistic regression analysis further confirmed the importance of the Glucose, BMI, and Age variables in predicting the risk of diabetes.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on developing tools that continuously monitor and track patients' Glucose levels, BMI, and Age, as these were identified as the most significant predictors of diabetes.\n2. Consider integrating data from additional sources (e.g., diet and exercise history) to improve the model's accuracy and identify more risk factors.\n3. Develop educational resources and guidelines for patients, specifically targeting glucose control, weight management, and lifestyle modifications as they age.\n4. Offer personalized risk assessments based on the significant predictors identified in this analysis, such as Glucose levels, BMI, and Age, to help inform patients and healthcare providers of potential risks and develop appropriate interventions.\n5. Consider conducting additional research on other factors such as genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle factors that might contribute to diabetes risk, as the current analysis is based solely on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. This would help generalize the findings and make the tools more applicable to a wider population."

The strongest correlations with diabetes outcome are Glucose (0.47), BMI (0.29), and Age (0.24).\n3. Patients with diabetes tend to have higher Glucose levels (141.26 vs. 109.98), BMI (35.14 vs. 30.30), and Age (37.07 vs. 31.19) compared to non-diabetic patients in this dataset.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. For patients with high glucose levels, provide meal plans that focus on low glycemic foods to help manage blood sugar.\n2. For patients with a high BMI, incorporate high fiber foods, lean protein sources, and controlled portion sizes to help manage weight.\n3. For older patients, ensure the meal plans also include controlled portion sizes to help maintain overall health."

        "content": "## Final report\n### Findings\n\n1. Customers with higher credit limits tend to have higher balances, make larger purchases, and use cash advances more frequently. They also make higher payments compared to customers with lower credit limits.\n2. Customers who frequently make purchases are less likely to use cash advances, and vice versa.\n3. The average amount spent in purchase transactions increases as the credit limit increases. However, the average amount spent in cash advance transactions remains relatively consistent across different credit limit groups, except for the highest credit limit group.\n4. Customers with a higher percentage of full payments are less likely to use cash advances and show relatively lower correlation with the average purchase transaction.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. Focus on improving customer retention among higher credit limit customers, as they tend to make more purchases and larger payments. Develop targeted marketing and promotions to encourage these customers to continue using the credit card services.\n2. Identify customers with a high percentage of full payments and low cash advance usage. These may represent a more financially responsible group who are more likely to continue using the credit card services. Tailor customized offers and incentives to retain these customers and maintain their loyalty.\n3. Analyze the factors that contribute to the negative correlation between customers who make frequent purchases and those who use cash advances. This may help in better understanding customer behaviors and designing specific strategies to address customer churn within these distinct groups.\n4. Revisit the product offerings, pricing strategies, and rewards programs related to cash advances, as customers who use them less frequently tend to have a higher percentage of full payments. Improving the cash advance experience and its associated costs may encourage more responsible usage and retain customers who might otherwise churn due to excessive cash advance fees or lack of attractive features.\n5. Consider engaging in further analysis and investigation using additional data that covers various aspects of customer churn and retention to gain a more comprehensive understanding of customer behaviors and improve the overall retention strategy."

The total amount of purchases is moderately correlated with credit card payments (PAYMENTS), one-off purchase frequency (ONE_OFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY), credit limit (CREDIT_LIMIT), and purchase installment frequency (PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY).\n3. Purchase frequency (PURCHASES_FREQUENCY) did not show any outliers and is uniformly distributed among the customers.\n4. The other significant variables have a considerable number of outliers, which might impact the correlation observed and may need further investigation or handling.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Marketing strategies can be focused on promoting one-off purchases and installment purchases, as both have a strong relationship with the total amount of purchases.\n2. Encourage customers to increase the number of purchase transactions and the contribution of one-off purchases as it can lead to an overall increase in the total amount spent on the credit card.\n3. Target customers with higher credit limits, as they tend to have a higher total amount of purchases.\n4. Investigate the outliers in significant variables to ensure data quality and to better understand if there are unique customer segments that could benefit from tailored marketing strategies. If necessary, consider handling or removing the outliers for a more robust analysis."

Channels with the highest subscribers, views, and video count come from a diverse range of categories, including Music, Education, Shows, Gaming, and People & Blogs.\n3. There is a strong positive correlation (0.75) between the number of subscribers and video views, implying that channels with more subscribers usually have more video views.\n4. The number of videos uploaded by a channel has a weak correlation with subscribers and views, meaning that simply having a large number of videos doesn't guarantee a higher subscriber or view count.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on creating interesting, engaging, and high-quality content in popular categories such as Entertainment, Music, and People & Blogs to attract more subscribers and views.\n2. Analyze successful channels in your category and observe their content strategies to identify what works and what doesn't in your niche.\n3. Actively promote your channel through collaborations, social media, and engaging with your audience to increase your subscriber base and potentially attract more views.\n4. Don't rely solely on the quantity of your videos; prioritize the quality and relevance of your content to provide value to your subscribers and viewers."

The dataset contains 1000 channels, categorized into 19 different categories.\n2. \"Entertainment\" has the most channels (238), followed by \"Music\" (217) and \"People & Blogs\" (132).\n3. The average number of subscribers, video views, and video count for all channels are 21,581,400, 9,994,912,409, and 9,416, respectively.\n4. For the top 10% channels by subscriber count, categories \"Entertainment\", \"Music\", and \"People & Blogs\" continue to dominate, but other categories like \"Education,\" \"Shows,\" and \"Sports\" have a higher representation as well.\n5. Channels in the top 10% have an average of 57,871,000 subscribers, 30,009,943,391 video views, and 16,638 video count.\n6. The channel with the highest subscribers-to-views ratio is \"Sports,\" which belongs to an unusual category from the dataset.\n7. The channel with the lowest subscribers-to-views ratio is \"netd m\u00fczik,\" a Music channel.\n8. The channel with the highest subscribers-to-video count ratio is \"Machinima,\" a Film & Animation channel.\n9. The channel with the lowest subscribers-to-video count ratio is \"GMA News,\" a News & Politics channel.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize advertising in channels with higher subscribers-to-views and subscribers-to-video count ratios, as they have higher user engagement.\n2. Target \"Entertainment\", \"Music\", and \"People & Blogs\" categories since they have the highest number of channels and large subscriber bases.\n3. Consider advertising in \"Education\", \"Shows\", and \"Sports\" categories for the top 10% channels, as they have higher representation and tend to be more influential.\n4. Avoid channels with low engagement metrics such as \"GMA News\" and \"netd m\u00fczik\" as they may not yield optimal results in ad placements.\n5. Regularly update the dataset and analyze it to stay up-to-date with channel trends and optimize future advertising strategies."

The top channels based on views per subscriber and average views per video do not always align with the top-ranking channels based on subscribers count.\n3. On average, channels in the News & Politics category have the highest age (13.70 years), while channels in the People & Blogs category have the lowest age (7.80 years).\n4. Only 10.60% of the top 1000 channels were started in the last 5 years, indicating that most of them have been running for a longer time.\n5. A balanced combination of views per subscriber, average views per video, and channel age highlights some potential partners that might not be in the top rankings based just on subscribers count.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize potential partnerships with channels in the Entertainment, Music, and People & Blogs categories, as they have the highest proportion of top subscribed channels.\n2. Consider channels with high views per subscriber and average views per video as these metrics indicate good engagement and can contribute to success in a partnership.\n3. Evaluate channels with relatively lower age to find potential partners that have experienced rapid growth in a shorter time.\n4. Focus on the top 10 channels based on the combined score considering views per subscriber, average views per video, and age, as they show a good balance of these metrics.\n5. Investigate the content, audience, and other aspects of identified potential partners more closely to ensure they align well with your brand values before making the final decision."

On average, channels in the Shows category have the most subscribers, followed by Trailers and Nonprofit & Activism categories.\n3. Channels in the Education category have the highest average video views, followed by Music and Sports.\n4. In terms of video count, News & Politics channels have the highest average number, followed by Sports and People & Blogs.\n5. There is a weak positive correlation between channel age and other variables like Subscribers, Video Views, and Video Count, indicating that older channels tend to have slightly more subscribers, views, and videos.\n6. The top 3 channels with the highest subscriber-to-video ratio are \u041d\u0422\u0412, YtCrash, and Super JoJo - Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs, meaning these channels gained many subscribers with relatively fewer videos.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider focusing on popular categories with the most channels, such as Entertainment, Music, and People & Blogs, for content and partnerships.\n2. Explore opportunities in categories with higher average subscribers and video views, such as Shows, Trailers, and Education, to maximize audience reach.\n3. Monitor the growth of channels with a high subscriber-to-video ratio, like \u041d\u0422\u0412, YtCrash, and Super JoJo - Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs, as they might have unique content strategies worth studying and applying.\n4. Look into collaborations with older and well-established channels for potential partnerships and cross-promotions, since they tend to have slightly more subscribers and video views.\n5. Investigate the content strategies of News & Politics and Sports channels, which may have high video count, to learn from their frequent content-release practices.\n6. Analyze more detailed metrics for better understanding of channel performance and engagement, such as watch time, audience demographics, and click-through rates, to develop specific and targeted business strategies."

Investigate channels like YouTube Movies that have a high subscriber count but no public video content. These channels may have unique characteristics or potential for future content offerings.\n4. Evaluate channels with high video views and video counts, regardless of their subscriber count, as they may have engaging content that can retain and attract viewers.\n5. Explore channels in the education, comedy, and gaming categories, as they are also popular choices and can offer variety to your platform or streaming service.\n6. Regularly update your recommendations based on updated subscriber, video view, and video count data, ensuring that your platform always recommends relevant and popular content."

Campaigns are conducted through three channels: \"Multichannel\", \"Phone\", and \"Web\".\n3. Customers are from three types of zip codes: \"Rural\", \"Suburban\", and \"Urban\".\n4. The highest conversion rate of 36.36% is achieved in \"No Offer\" campaigns, conducted through \"Multichannel\" and targeting \"Rural\" customers.\n5. \"Discount\" offers through the \"Web\" channel are generally effective, with conversion rates above 17% in both \"Rural\" and \"Urban\" zip codes.\n6. \"Buy One Get One\" offers through \"Multichannel\" have higher conversion rates in \"Rural\" (21.54%) compared to \"Suburban\" (18.37%) and \"Urban\" (17.51%).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate resources to \"No Offer\" campaigns directed at \"Rural\" customers through the \"Multichannel\" channel, as these campaigns have the highest conversion rates.\n2. Increase the focus on \"Discount\" offers through the \"Web\" channel in both rural and urban areas, as they consistently show high conversion rates above 17%.\n3. Explore more \"Buy One Get One\" offers via \"Multichannel\", especially in rural areas, to capitalize on their comparatively higher conversion rates.\n4. Consider reallocating budget from less effective campaigns (such as \"No Offer\" campaigns in \"Urban\" and \"Suburban\" areas) to the higher-performing campaigns mentioned above.\n5. Investigate the factors that contribute to the success of \"No Offer\" campaigns in \"Rural\" areas (e.g., customer preferences, accessibility, and competition) to optimize and customize future marketing strategies.\n6. Finally, it's essential to continuously monitor and assess the performance of these marketing promotions to ensure that resources are allocated effectively and efficiently in future campaigns."

It mainly focuses on the conversion rate when customers receive different promotional offers.\n2. The descriptive statistics of numerical columns reveal that the average customer recency is 5.74 months, the mean spending history is $243.23, and the conversion rate is 14%.\n3. The categorical data analysis indicates that most customers (45%) live in suburban areas, followed by urban (40%) and rural (15%). The most preferred channels for customers are web and phone, while multichannel accounts for nearly 12%. The offers are distributed almost equally among the types: Buy One Get One (33%), Discount (33%), and No Offer (33%).\n4. The conversion rate varies by different attributes. Customers from rural areas have a higher conversion rate (19%) compared to suburban (13%) and urban (14%) customers. The conversion rate is also higher for multichannel communication (17%) than for web (15%) and phone (13%). The discount offer has the highest conversion rate (18%), followed by Buy One Get One (15%) and No Offer (10%).\n5. The correlation matrix analysis shows a weak negative relationship between customer recency and conversion (-0.08). There are also weak positive correlations between customer spending history, used_bogo, and conversion.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Conduct further analysis on regional segmentation to optimize promotional strategies for suburban, urban, and rural customers, as their conversion rates differ.\n2. Focus marketing efforts on the multichannel approach, as it has shown higher conversion rates compared to web and phone.\n3. Continue offering discounts and Buy One Get One promotions as they have higher conversion rates compared to not offering any promotion.\n4. Target new or less frequent customers (lower recency), as their conversion rate is marginally higher than that of customers with high recency.\n5. Consider exploring techniques such as feature engineering, clustering analysis, and A/B testing to gain more insights and improve the promotion campaigns further."

The countries with the highest total cases are OWID_WRL, OWID_NAM, USA, OWID_EUR, and OWID_SAM.\n3. The outbreak duration varies among countries, but the longest outbreak durations were observed in countries like COG, OWID_AFR, OWID_ASI, OWID_WRL, and NGA, with durations up to 369 days.\n4. The month with the highest number of new cases was August 2022, with 2,646,400 cases.\n5. The month with the highest number of new deaths was April 2023, with 25 deaths.\n6. The steepest increase in case fatality rate occurred from April 2023 to May 2023, with an increase of 0.0296.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate more resources and support towards countries with the highest number of cases and longest outbreak durations identified in the findings.\n2. Investigate the reasons behind the dramatic increase in case fatality rate from April to May 2023 to prevent future escalations.\n3. Monitor the countries with high numbers of cases and deaths, and collaborate with their public health agencies to improve surveillance and containment strategies.\n4. Consider implementing stricter measures, such as travel advisories or restrictions, during periods with high numbers of new cases to limit the spread of the virus.\n5. Encourage countries to share their successful strategies in addressing the outbreak and adopt best practices internationally.\n6. Invest in research and development for effective treatments, preventive measures, and public health education regarding monkeypox."

The table of stock metrics displays various characteristics, including the average opening and closing prices, the highest and lowest prices, and the average volume for each stock.\n3. The average percentage change between the opening and closing prices provides insights into the overall growth or decline of each stock.\n4. The rolling average of the daily percentage change with a 30-day window is calculated to evaluate the recent performance of each stock.\n  \n### Suggestions\n1. Consider focusing on stocks with a positive average percentage change, as these stocks tend to grow in value.\n2. Examine the recent performance (rolling average of the daily percentage change) to identify stocks with a consistent growth trend, which may indicate stronger potential for future growth.\n3. When making a decision on whether to buy or sell a stock, consider its lowest and highest prices as potential risk indicators. For example, stocks with a smaller difference between the lowest and highest prices may present a lower risk due to the limited price fluctuation.\n4. Look at the average trading volume of a stock as an indicator of liquidity. Higher trading volumes may imply greater market interest and easier entry or exit points for investments.\n5. Monitor news and updates about the companies you are considering investing in, as external factors may significantly influence stock prices and trends.\n6. It is essential to be aware that past performance is not a guarantee of future results; thus, conducting thorough research, assessing individual risk tolerance, and consulting with a financial advisor are crucial before making any investment decisions."

The most profitable stock is MRNA with an average daily return of 0.192400, which is significantly higher than the market average.\n4. The standard deviation of the daily returns shows that MRNA, ZM, PDD, and PTON have the highest volatility among the top 10 companies.\n5. The Sharpe Ratio, a risk-adjusted return metric, ranks the top 10 companies as follows: MRNA, PTON, CRWD, DOCU, OKTA, ZM, TEAM, PDD, TSLA, and NFLX.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider investing in the stocks with the highest Sharpe Ratios (MRNA, PTON, CRWD, DOCU, and OKTA), as they offer higher returns adjusted for volatility.\n2. Be cautious of highly volatile stocks like MRNA, ZM, PDD, and PTON, as they carry higher risk despite their high average returns.\n3. For a more conservative investment, consider TEAM and NFLX, which have relatively lower volatility and still offer higher returns than the market average.\n4. To reduce potential risks, diversify the portfolio by investing in multiple high-performing stocks across different industries.\n5. Monitor the market trends and company performance regularly to adjust the investment strategy accordingly."

TSLA (Tesla Inc) has the highest cumulative return among the NASDAQ-100 stocks, with a cumulative return of 174.73, which means that it has grown more than 174 times its initial value since 2010.\n2. The top 5 stocks with the highest cumulative returns include TSLA, NFLX (Netflix), NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation), DXCM (DexCom Inc), and MELI (MercadoLibre Inc).\n3. The average daily return and cumulative return of the stocks have a positive correlation of 0.34, indicating a moderate relationship between the two metrics.\n4. The top 5 stocks exhibit varying levels of daily return volatility, with TSLA having the highest volatility and NVDA having the lowest among the top 5.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Based on the analysis, consider adding or increasing the allocation to TSLA, NFLX, NVDA, DXCM, and MELI in the mutual fund's portfolio as these stocks have demonstrated strong cumulative returns over the period.\n2. Take into account the volatility levels of these top-performing stocks. Understand that stocks with high returns could also have high volatility (risk), such as TSLA. Diversify your investments by allocating different weights to stocks across various sectors and risk levels to balance risk and potential returns.\n3. Continuously monitor and update the investments by analyzing trends in historical data and adopting appropriate risk management strategies. This will allow for quick and informed decisions when adjusting the fund\u2019s investments.\n4. Lastly, while data analysis presents useful insights, it's essential to consider other factors like macroeconomic trends, changes in the industry landscape, and company-specific factors that may impact these companies' future prospects and performance."

The Mediterranean is the region with the highest number of missing migrants, with 2,356 deaths.\n3. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region of origin with the highest number of missing migrants, with 1,324 deaths.\n4. The most common cause of death among missing migrants is drowning, accounting for 2,933 deaths.\n5. There are three reliability levels for the sources in the dataset: Verified, Partially Verified, and Partially verified. Verified sources account for 3,185 deaths, while Partially Verified and Partially verified sources account for 3,098 and 565 deaths, respectively.\n6. The number of missing migrants was the highest in 2015 with 2,728 deaths, and the lowest in 2017 with 685 deaths.\n7. December has the highest number of missing migrants with 1,107 deaths, while April has the lowest with 279 deaths.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus allocation of resources and support on the regions with the highest incidents of missing migrants, with priority given to the Mediterranean region.\n2. Establish collaborative efforts with origin countries, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, to address the root causes of migration and provide support to improve living conditions and opportunities.\n3. Engage in raising awareness and advocate for safer migration paths, given the high number of deaths caused by drowning.\n4. Work closely with local agencies and governments in the regions with the highest number of missing migrants and develop systems to improve the verification and reliability of the data on missing migrants.\n5. Monitor the temporal trends of missing migrants to identify potential factors affecting the fluctuations in the number of deaths and to tailor interventions accordingly.\n6. Given the increased number of deaths in specific months like December, consider allocating additional resources during these periods to mitigate the risks faced by migrants."

The highest number of deaths originates from Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by the MENA region and Central America & Mexico.\n3. The Mediterranean is the most common incident region for missing migrants, followed by North Africa and the U.S./Mexico border.\n4. There is a significant variation in the number of deaths in different years across different regions of origin and incident regions.\n5. The data has two different reliability levels (Partially Verified and Verified). The majority of data comes from verified sources, but there is also a significant portion from partially verified sources.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Implement policies to improve maritime safety and rescue operations, especially in the Mediterranean, as drowning is the leading cause of death among missing migrants in this region.\n2. Collaborate with countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the MENA region, and Central America & Mexico to develop strategies that address the root causes of migration, such as political instability, poverty, and human rights abuses.\n3. Strengthen national and international efforts to accurately track and identify missing migrants, particularly by improving the reporting of incidents and causes of death, and addressing the issue of unknown causes and skeletal remains.\n4. Monitor migration trends and changes in the number of deaths over time to effectively deploy resources and adjust policies in response to emerging patterns and regions of high risk.\n5. Improve the reliability and consistency of data sources to make better-informed decisions and devise evidence-based strategies to address the causes of death among missing migrants."

The top 5 causes of death among missing migrants are drowning, unknown (skeletal remains), shot, presumed drowning, and sickness and a lack of access to medicines.\n2. The top incident regions are the U.S./Mexico Border, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Central America incl. Mexico, and Europe.\n3. The top origin regions are Central America & Mexico, Horn of Africa, Central America, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the Horn of Africa (P).\n4. The highest number of deaths occurred in 2015, followed by 2014, 2016, and 2017.\n5. Most incidents in the dataset are partially verified, with fewer being fully verified.\n6. There is a high correlation between drowning and incidents occurring in the Mediterranean region.\n7. The most common migration route for migrants originating from Central America & Mexico is towards the U.S./Mexico Border and Central America incl. Mexico. For migrants from the Horn of Africa, the main incident regions are North Africa and Europe.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize efforts to address the leading causes of death, particularly drowning, by providing resources and support for search and rescue operations and improving safety measures in high-risk areas.\n2. Focus on the top incident regions for humanitarian aid and resources, especially along the U.S./Mexico Border, the Mediterranean, and North Africa.\n3. Collaborate with governments and international organizations to address the root causes of migration in top origin regions, such as poverty, conflict, and persecution.\n4. Improve the verification process for data collection to achieve more reliable information, possibly by strengthening partnerships with local authorities and organizations.\n5. Consider the most common migration routes when planning interventions, such as providing support to migrants on their journey or working with transit countries to ensure safer conditions.\n6. Encourage research and information-sharing on underrepresented migration routes and incident regions to fill knowledge gaps and allow for more tailored support to migrants in these areas."

The majority of migrants originate from Central America & Mexico, Horn of Africa, and the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) region.\n3. Incident regions with the highest number of cases are the U.S./Mexico Border and the Mediterranean, followed by North Africa and Central America.\n4. The reliability of the data sources varies, with a significant proportion being partially verified, indicating the need for cautious interpretation.\n5. The number of incidents has been fluctuating over the years, with a noticeable decrease in the most recent year (2017).\n6. The latitude and longitude of incidents show weak correlations with the number of deaths, indicating that the number of deaths cannot be solely explained by geographic patterns.\n7. The Mediterranean region experiences the highest number of deaths per incident, followed by Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n8. Regional differences in causes of death exist; for example, in the U.S./Mexico Border, unknown causes (skeletal remains) are more common, while drowning is the leading cause in the Mediterranean, and vehicle accidents are more prevalent in North Africa.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus media campaigns and awareness-raising efforts on the most affected regions, i.e., the U.S./Mexico Border and the Mediterranean, as well as North Africa and Central America.\n2. Advocate for improved migration policies and additional support for migrants in regions with the highest number of deaths per incident, such as the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n3. Call for thorough investigations and documentation of missing migrant incidents in order to increase the reliability of data sources, and better understand the circumstances surrounding these cases.\n4. Highlight regional differences in the causes of death among migrants to tailor policy and support recommendations, such as addressing drowning risks in the Mediterranean, improving safety measures for transportation-related accidents in North Africa, and protecting migrants from extreme weather conditions at the U.S./Mexico Border.\n5. Encourage international cooperation to address the root causes of migration and promote safe migration pathways, particularly for people originating from Central America & Mexico, the Horn of Africa, and the MENA region.\n6. Monitor and evaluate the impact of policies and interventions aimed at reducing migration-related deaths and incidents over time, using data analysis to inform future policymaking and support strategies."

        "content": "## Final report\n### Findings\n1. The dataset records 6,848 migrant deaths from various causes and regions.\n2. The most common causes of death are drowning, unknown (skeletal remains), and shootings.\n3. The origin regions with the highest number of migrant deaths are Sub-Saharan Africa, MENA (Middle East and North Africa), and Central America & Mexico.\n4. The regions with the most incidents include the U.S./Mexico border and the Mediterranean.\n5. Differences in the distribution of incident regions and causes of death were observed between verified and partially verified sources, indicating varied data reliability.\n6. Temporal trends show that deaths and incidents vary by year, month, and day of the week, suggesting fluctuating patterns over time rather than a constant rate.\n7. The relationship between cause of death and region of origin reveals that different causes of death are prominent in different origin regions, suggesting varying conditions and risks faced by migrants from different regions.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Strengthen data collection methods to ensure comprehensive understanding of migrant deaths, and consequently better address human trafficking and migrant exploitation issues.\n2. Investigate the differences between verified and partially verified sources to improve data reliability, enabling more accurate conclusions and informed decision-making.\n3. Explore additional factors for analysis, such as smuggling routes or socio-economic factors of origin regions, to better understand the contexts that lead to human trafficking and migrant exploitation.\n4. Incorporate survivor testimonies or stories in the dataset to provide in-depth context for the data, further humanize the issue, and motivate actions to address the issues of human trafficking and migrant exploitation.\n5. Collaborate with organizations and authorities from the identified high-risk origin regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, MENA, and Central America & Mexico, to develop targeted interventions and policies.\n6. Allocate resources for monitoring and surveillance in the most incident-prone regions - the U.S./Mexico border and the Mediterranean - in order to prevent further loss of lives and combat human trafficking and migrant exploitation more effectively."

The most common cause of death in the dataset is drowning, with 388 occurrences, followed by unknown causes (skeletal remains) with 170 occurrences, and shootings with 76 occurrences. \n2. The Mediterranean region has the highest number of deaths (2356) among all incident regions, followed by North Africa (1094) and the U.S./Mexico Border (980).\n3. The majority of deaths originate from the Sub-Saharan Africa region (19.33% of total deaths) followed by the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region (16% of total deaths) and Central America & Mexico (13.25% of total deaths).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Avoid the Mediterranean region as a migration route due to the high number of deaths, and consider alternative routes with fewer incidents, such as the Caribbean or South America.\n2. Provide resources and education on water safety to migrants who may be at risk of drowning, such as those crossing bodies of water or traveling via boat.\n3. Increase safety measures and monitoring along the U.S./Mexico Border to prevent the number of deaths from increasing.\n4. Focus support and resources on migrants coming from Sub-Saharan Africa, the MENA region, and Central America & Mexico, as they account for almost 50% of the total deaths in the dataset.\n5. Encourage collaborative efforts among countries and organizations to address the root causes of migration in high-risk areas and improve overall migration safety."

Drowning is the most common cause of death for migrants, with 1,849 cases in the Mediterranean.\n3. The incident region with the highest number of dead/missing migrants is the Mediterranean, with 2,356 cases, followed by North Africa with 1,094 cases.\n4. The highest number of dead/missing migrants in a single month is 680, which occurred in December 2015.\n5. The correlation between the number of dead/missing migrants (dead) and geographical coordinates (lat, lon) shows a slight positive relationship with longitude and a slight negative relationship with latitude, although not strong.\n6. The highest number of dead/missing migrants based on their origin is from Sub-Saharan Africa, with 1,324 cases, followed closely by MENA (Middle East and North Africa), with 1,096 cases.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. Focus search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean region, particularly on drowning-related incidents, as it has the highest number of dead/missing migrants.\n2. Coordinate efforts with other NGOs and organizations working in the Mediterranean region to pool resources and improve search and rescue operations.\n3. Monitor temporal trends and anticipate increased search and rescue activity during peak months, such as December.\n4. Develop partnerships with reliable sources of information, such as the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat and UNHCR, to stay updated on the migration trends and incidents.\n5. Pay special attention to migrants originating from Sub-Saharan Africa and the MENA region, as they face the highest number of dead/missing incidents.\n6. Consider expanding search and rescue presence in the North Africa region, which was the second-highest incident region in the dataset, and collaborate with local authorities to enhance search efforts."

The average number of migrant deaths per year decreased from 8.17 in 2014 to 3.16 in 2017.\n3. The region_origins with the most migrant deaths are Sub-Saharan Africa (1324 deaths), MENA (1096 deaths), and Central America & Mexico (908 deaths).\n4. The most common causes of death are drowning (388 incidents, 2933 deaths), unknown (skeletal remains, 170 incidents), and being shot (76 incidents, 141 deaths).\n5. The reliability of sources is categorized into Verified, Partially Verified, and Partially verified. Verified sources report higher average deaths (5.91) than others.\n6. There is a weak positive correlation between longitude and the number of deaths (0.14), and a weak negative correlation between latitude and the number of deaths (-0.05).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on policy changes and interventions in the high-risk regions, specifically Sub-Saharan Africa, MENA, and Central America & Mexico.\n2. Increase awareness campaigns on the dangers of drowning, address the issue of unknown (skeletal remains), and implement measures to prevent violence and shootings.\n3. Strengthen data collection and encourage more reliable sources to improve the accuracy of the dataset, especially for incidents recorded with lower reliability ratings.\n4. Enhance communication and collaboration between countries in high-risk regions to develop and implement migration policies for reducing deaths.\n5. Conduct further studies that analyze the location data in more detail to better understand the geographical factors that may contribute to increased death rates."

Average energy consumption per charging event is 5.62 kWh, with a standard deviation of 2.23 kWh.\n3. Charging events are mostly concentrated on weekdays, with Thursday having the highest frequency (21.50%).\n4. The average charge time for all charging events is 2.84 hours.\n5. Most charging events (56.1%) take place at facility type 3, followed by facility type 1 (24.3%) and facility type 2 (18.9%). The least number of events occur at facility type 4 (0.8%).\n6. The charge event frequency on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) is very low (2.27% and 0.64%, respectively) compared to weekdays.\n7. The average cost per kWh is higher at facility types 3 and 4 ($0.03/kWh) compared to facility types 1 and 2 ($0.01 and $0.02/kWh, respectively).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To accommodate a 50% increase in Electric Vehicle (EV) usage, 28 more charging stations should be installed in facility type 3, 15 in facility type 1, 10 in facility type 2, and none in facility type 4.\n2. Prioritize installing more charging stations in high-demand neighborhoods and areas with a high concentration of workplaces, as most charging events take place on weekdays.\n3. Consider expanding charging infrastructure with lower average costs/kWh, such as facility types 1 and 2, to encourage more EV adoption and provide cost-effective charging options for users.\n4. Evaluate potential incentives (e.g., discounted pricing, better charging locations) to encourage EV users to charge during weekends or less congested hours to even out the charging demand across the week.\n5. Continually monitor and analyze EV charging behavior and usage patterns to inform future planning and expansion of EV charging infrastructure."

It is lowest on Sundays (2.16 hours).\n2. The average charging time by hour is highest at the 11 am (3.23 hours) and lowest at the 23 pm (0.63 hours).\n3. Overall, the vehicles tend to start charging more frequently during mid-day hours (10 am to 4 pm) across all weekdays, and the least busy time is during weekends and late evenings.\n4. Manager vehicles tend to charge slightly longer (2.93 hours) compared to non-manager vehicles (2.71 hours) and consume more energy on average (5.82 kWh vs 5.31 kWh).\n5. Facility types 3 and 4 show the highest average energy consumption and charging time compared to facility types 1 and 2.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To minimize downtime, consider prioritizing charging during weekends (if possible) and late evenings since the demand during these times is lower, which may lead to shorter charging times.\n2. Encourage users to start charging earlier in the day (especially non-manager vehicles) when the average charging time is shorter.\n3. Allocate more charging stations for facility types 3 and 4 since they have the highest energy consumption and charging time requirements.\n4. Investigate the reasons behind the differences in charging patterns between manager and non-manager vehicles to better understand their usage habits and optimize their charging schedules accordingly."

The majority of EV charging sessions occur on weekdays, with the highest number on Thursdays (21.5%) and the lowest on Sundays (0.64%).\n3. 79.87% of sessions use the iOS platform, while 20.13% use Android.\n4. The average charging time by facility type varies slightly, with type 1 facilities having the shortest average charging time (2.47 hours) and type 4 facilities the longest (3.03 hours).\n5. There is a moderate positive correlation between the charging time and energy consumption (kWh) (r = 0.45), meaning that as the charging time increases, the energy consumption tends to increase as well.\n6. The average distance traveled varies between users on different platforms, with iOS users traveling 18.87 miles on average and Android users 17.80 miles.\n7. The average distance traveled also varies among weekdays, with the longest distances occurring on Saturdays (22.96 miles) and the shortest on Sundays (10.49 miles).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Encourage users to charge their vehicles during off-peak times on weekends, especially Sundays, which currently have the lowest number of charging sessions.\n2. Explore the potential reasons for the difference in average distance traveled between iOS and Android users, which could lead to insights on improving user experience or charging station coverage.\n3. Investigate the variation in average charging times among facility types to identify factors that contribute to shorter or longer charging times, which could help improve charging efficiency.\n4. Promote efficient charging habits by educating users on the correlation between charging time and energy consumption, and provide guidance on optimizing energy use.\n5. Conduct further research on the factors affecting energy consumption, such as vehicle models and battery capacities, to better understand the variation in energy consumption among users."

The data contains 2,330 EV charging sessions with energy consumption ranging from 0.01 to 20.38 kWh and charging time ranging from 0.04 to 11.59 hours.\n2. The highest total energy consumption occurred on Thursdays (2,863 kWh), and the lowest on Sundays (68 kWh).\n3. The highest average energy consumption per hour occurred at 22:00 (6.83 kWh), while the lowest at 23:00 (1.87 kWh).\n4. Facility type 3 accounted for the majority of the total energy consumed (43.5%), followed by facility type 1 (36.9%) and facility type 2 (19.4%).\n5. Facility types showed varying patterns of energy consumption and charging time across the week, with different peak hours and session distributions.\n6. The energy consumption and charging patterns for iOS and Android platform users were quite similar, with only minor differences in average energy consumed and session distribution across the week.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Plan for additional grid capacity during the busiest hours (late afternoons and evenings) and on weekdays, especially Thursdays.\n2. Consider the different energy consumption patterns and characteristics of each facility type when planning for grid capacity improvements or expansions.\n3. Encourage off-peak charging by offering incentives or discounts for users who charge their EVs during less busy hours (such as late evenings or early mornings).\n4. Monitor and analyze the platform usage patterns and energy consumption trends over time, especially if new features or changes are introduced in the EV charging services. This will help inform future capacity planning and improve the overall efficiency of the charging network.\n5. As the EV charging market continues to grow, consider partnering with charging stations or EV manufacturers to gather more detailed usage data, which will help improve the accuracy and effectiveness of future grid capacity planning efforts."

To compare your restaurant's performance, calculate the percentage of your sales, units, and unit volume relative to the total sales, units, and unit volume of the respective competitor groups (Top250, Independence100, Future50).\n\n2. Check if your restaurant's percentages are above the average in each respective category and table. This will help you understand if your restaurant is outperforming its competitors.\n\n3. Focus on the specific group (Top250, Independence100, Future50) that aligns better with your restaurant's concept, and aim to improve your ranking within that group.\n\n4. Look for trends or commonalities among the top-performing restaurants in your competitor group. Identify areas where your restaurant can learn from them, such as menu offerings, customer service, or marketing strategies.\n\n5. Regularly update and review your analysis to track your progress and make data-driven adjustments to your business strategies as necessary."

The top 3 categories with the highest average sales per unit are: Fine Dining & Steak, Steak, and Asian.\n3. Fast Casual & Pizza, Healthy, and Fast Casual & Burger have experienced the highest average YOY (Year-over-Year) sales growth.\n4. The top 3 categories with the highest average YOY units growth are: Fast Casual & Pizza, Healthy, and Fast Casual & Burger.\n5. Fine Dining & Steak has the highest average sales per unit but moderate YOY sales growth (4.7%) and no YOY unit growth.\n6. Categories such as Quick Service & Burger and Quick Service & Chicken have high total sales and relatively lower YOY sales growth.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider investing in Fast Casual & Pizza and Healthy categories as they have demonstrated high growth in both sales and units.\n2. Fast Casual & Burger might also be an interesting investment opportunity considering its high YOY growth in sales and units. Note that its average sales per unit is lower compared to Fast Casual & Pizza and Healthy.\n3. Asian category has a high average sales per unit and could be a potential investment opportunity considering its steadily growing sales and unit metrics.\n4. Fine Dining & Steak could be a niche investment focusing on high average sales per unit, but keep in mind its moderate YOY sales growth and stagnant unit growth.\n5. As an alternative strategy, you could consider investing in top-performing individual restaurants within categories that have moderate total sales and growth, as they might be undiscovered gems in the market.\n\nNote: It's important to mention that these suggestions are based on the available data, and factors like market trends and specific geographic locations should also be considered in your final decision making."

We filtered the restaurants that are already franchising and have strong sales and unit growth (above 20%).\n3. We found 22 potential franchise opportunities across both tables, including 13 from the Future50 and 9 from the Top250.\n4. The average sales growth among these combined franchise opportunities is 44.49%, and the average unit growth is 39.62%.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Begin with focusing on well-performing restaurants from both the Future50 and Top250 tables that have a combination of both strong sales growth and strong unit growth.\n2. Prioritize the potential franchise opportunities that match your target market, industry segment, and geographical preferences.\n3. Conduct additional research on each of the 22 potential franchise opportunities, such as examining their unique selling propositions, brand reputation, target demographics, and initial costs for franchising.\n4. Reach out to the selected franchise opportunities for more detailed information, such as costs, franchise agreement terms, and expectations for the future growth of the brand.\n5. Finally, based on your research, negotiations, and overall compatibility with the potential franchises, make informed decisions on which franchise opportunities to invest in and execute your expansion strategy."

Consider featuring niche and high-end independent restaurants such as Del Posto, Prime Steakhouse, SW Steakhouse, Prime 112, and Prime & Provisions due to their high average checks, which could indicate exceptional dining experiences and exclusive clienteles.\n5. Look into the growth of fast-casual brands like Chicken Salad Chick, Metro Diner, First Watch, Shake Shack, and Walk-On's Sports Bistreaux, which are among the top performers in YOY sales and units growth in the Top250 list, indicating a significant shift in customer preferences toward more casual and diverse dining options."

All analyzed players hold the Grandmaster (GM) title.\n3. The top 5 countries with the highest number of players in the analyzed dataset are the Russian Federation, the United States, India, Ukraine, and China.\n4. The players' ages range from 17 to 58, with an average age of 33.6 years.\n5. Players are categorized into four age groups: 18 or younger, 19-35, 36-50, and 50+. The majority of the players (119) fall into the 19-35 age group.\n6. ELO ratings do not show a significant difference across age groups; they are relatively similar among all categories.\n7. There is a very weak correlation between ELO rating and age, a weak correlation between ELO rating and the number of games played, and a strong correlation between age and the number of games played.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To determine the odds of the players winning a tournament, it is important to consider additional factors beyond ELO ratings and age, as the correlation between these factors appears to be weak.\n2. Investigate other factors that could impact the odds, such as head-to-head results against other top players, recent performance, and tournament win rate.\n3. For a more accurate projection of the odds, consider taking into account factors that may have influenced each player's past performance, such as psychological aspects, injury risks, or coaching changes.\n4. If the data is available, examine the players' performance with different time controls (rapid, classical, blitz) to better assess their individual strengths and weaknesses in various tournament formats.\n5. Conduct further research on specific opponent matchups and styles, as this can significantly influence the odds of a player winning. Additionally, consider how a player's preferences might interact with tournament structures or tiebreakers.\n6. Use various betting models, such as Elo-based, TrueSkill, or Glicko, to make predictions and analyze their reliability over time using cross-validation techniques.\n7. Regularly update the analysis with new data as it becomes available, to ensure that the odds remain accurate and up-to-date."

        "content": "## Final report\n### Findings\n1. The average ELO rating among the top 200 players is 2662.39, with a standard deviation of 47.21.\n2. Players have played between 277 and 3913 games, with a mean of 1394.18 games played in the dataset.\n3. Youngest players have high ELO ratings, such as Alireza Firouzja (born in 2003) with an ELO of 2793, indicating rising talent among young players.\n4. The top 3 countries with the highest average ELO ratings are Norway, Bulgaria, and the United States.\n5. There is a moderate positive correlation (0.39) between the number of games played and ELO ratings, suggesting that more experienced players tend to have higher ratings.\n6. The title distribution for players in the dataset is GM (Grandmaster) for all 200 players, indicating that the dataset is focused on top-level players.\n7. There is an increase in the average ELO ratings from players born in the 1960s to those born in the 1990s, but a slight decrease among those born in the 2000s. This might be due to the younger players still having time to improve their ratings.\n8. There is a strong positive correlation (0.67) between the age of players and the number of games played, meaning that older players played more games, as expected.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on players with high ELO ratings and young age as potential future stars, such as Alireza Firouzja and Nihal Sarin.\n2. Cover players with a high number of games played to utilize their extensive playing history for content and in-depth analysis, such as Viswanathan Anand and Loek Van Wely.\n3. Highlight upcoming talent from countries with high average ELO ratings, like Norway, Bulgaria, and the United States, as they may produce strong players in the future.\n4. Consider creating content comparing different generations of players, as there are noticeable changes in ELO ratings and the number of games played across different age groups.\n5. Analyze the playing styles and strategies of players with high ELO ratings and many games played, as their experience might lead to valuable insights for your audience.\n6. Keep an eye on the youngest players in the dataset to track their progress and predict their future performance based on trends observed in older generations of players."

Countries with the highest average cost per unit are Guatemala, Afghanistan, and the Dominican Republic.\n3. The cost per unit for Anti-Malaria (ACT) and Anti-TB (ANTM) products is significantly higher than for the ARV products.\n4. Manufacturing sites with the highest cost per unit include ABBVIE (Abbott) St. P'burg USA, Roche Madrid, and Medochemie Factory A, Cyprus.\n5. The correlation between Weight (Kilograms) and Freight Cost (USD) is moderate at 0.52.\n6. Cost per kilogram is highest for Shipment Mode Air Charter, followed by Air, Ocean, and the lowest for Truck.\n7. Countries with the highest cost per kilogram are Nigeria, Guyana, and Congo, DRC.\n8. Product groups with the highest cost per kilogram are ACT, ARV, and ANTM.\n9. Manufacturing sites with the highest cost per kilogram are Novartis Pharma Suffern, USA, Strides, Bangalore, India, and Weifa, Oslo, Norway.\n10. Dosage forms with the highest cost per kilogram are Tablet - FDC + blister, Tablet - FDC + co-blister, and Delayed-release capsules.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider using Ocean shipment mode more frequently to decrease the average cost per unit shipped, as it has the lowest average cost per unit among all shipment modes.\n2. Investigate possible cost-saving opportunities in logistic arrangements for countries with higher average costs per unit, particularly Guatemala, Afghanistan, and the Dominican Republic.\n3. Analyze Anti-Malaria (ACT) and Anti-TB (ANTM) product shipment costs in detail to explore cost reducing possibilities compared to ARV products.\n4. Explore alternative manufacturing sites for products with higher cost per unit, especially those associated with ABBVIE (Abbott) St. P'burg USA, Roche Madrid, and Medochemie Factory A, Cyprus.\n5. Focus on optimizing freight costs by looking into the relationship between weight and freight costs and identifying areas of improvement in packaging, shipment mode selection, etc.\n6. Investigate the shipment processes for countries such as Nigeria, Guyana, and Congo, DRC, where cost per kilogram is significantly higher and explore potential cost-saving options.\n7. Analyze product groups and manufacturing sites with the highest cost per kilogram to identify opportunities for cost optimization.\n8. Examine the cost implications of different dosage forms and explore the possibilities of switching between different forms to reduce the overall cost per kilogram."

Line item quantity has a strong positive correlation (0.86) with line item value and line item insurance (0.82), suggesting that as the quantity of items shipped increases, both the total value and insurance costs of the shipment increase as well.\n3. Pack price and unit price are positively correlated (0.56), indicating that a higher pack price generally comes with a higher unit price.\n4. However, pack price and unit price have a weak negative correlation with line item quantity and line item value, suggesting that these pricing factors may not be the main drivers of shipment quantity and value.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider increasing warehouse capacity and inventory in countries where average line item quantity and line item value are high, as these locations exhibit higher demand for products.\n2. Prioritize arrangements with vendors that offer lower pack and unit prices for larger shipments, as this could lead to cost savings.\n3. Monitor and analyze how changes in shipment pricing factors, such as pack price and unit price, impact shipment quantities and line item values to effectively adjust warehouse capacity and inventory management strategies in the future.\n4. Look for other factors that may be driving shipment quantity and value (e.g., economic conditions, local demand, etc.) to better inform decisions on warehouse capacity and inventory management."

The average shipment price varies significantly across different shipment modes, with air shipments being the least expensive and ocean shipments being the most expensive.\n2. There is a similar variation in average freight cost and insurance cost across different shipment modes, with air charter shipments having the highest freight costs and insurance costs.\n3. The correlation between shipment weight and freight cost is 0.52, indicating a moderate positive relationship between the two variables.\n4. The average delivery delay across all shipment modes is -7.54 days, meaning that deliveries are typically arriving 7.54 days earlier than scheduled.\n5. The average delivery delay varies across different shipment modes and product groups, with some combinations experiencing longer delays, such as air charters delivering ARVs.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider using different shipment modes for different types of products, taking into account the cost, insurance, and delivery delays associated with each mode.\n2. Monitor and track the relationship between shipment weight and freight cost, and consider adjusting shipping strategies for particularly heavy or light shipments to minimize costs.\n3. Investigate why certain shipment modes and product groups are experiencing longer delays than others, and take appropriate action to improve delivery times.\n4. Use findings from this analysis to create contingency plans and risk mitigation strategies for potential supply chain disruptions.\n5. Continuously analyze shipment data, update findings, and adjust shipping strategies accordingly to optimize costs, minimize risks, and improve delivery performance."

There is a strong correlation between the star type and the star's color and spectral class, which indicates that these factors are closely related and could be used to predict the star type.\n4.

Consider using a machine learning algorithm that can predict star types based on the combination of spectral class, star color, temperature, luminosity, radius, and absolute magnitude, as they are shown to be related through the analysis.\n2. Create classification models focusing on color and spectral class as key predictors, since these features show a strong correlation with star type.\n3.

The most common star color in the dataset is Red (46.67%), followed by Blue (22.92%), Blue-white (10.83%), and several other colors with lower frequencies.\n2. Different star colors have distinct temperature ranges, with Blue and White stars having the highest average temperatures, and Red stars having the lowest.\n3. Luminosity, radius, and absolute magnitude also vary significantly across star colors.\n4. There are correlations between star colors and their spectral class (e.g., Red stars are most common in class M, and Blue-white stars are most common in class A).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider grouping some similar star colors together (e.g., \"Blue-white\", \"Blue White\", and \"Blue White\") for a more unified analysis.\n2. Investigate further the relationship between star colors, spectral classes, and other star characteristics to make more specific conclusions about the stars' formation and evolution processes.\n3. Since the dataset size is relatively small (240 entries), consider obtaining more data to validate and support the findings from this dataset, as the current data might not be enough to represent the full diversity of stars in the universe."

Brown Dwarfs and Red Dwarfs have the lowest temperature, with average temperatures of 2997.95 K and 3283.83 K, respectively.\n3. Hypergiants have the largest radius (averaging 1366.90 R/Ro) and highest luminosity (averaging 309246.53 L/Lo).\n4. Main Sequence stars and Supergiants have similar average temperatures (16018 K and 15347.85 K, respectively), but Main Sequence stars have a smaller average radius (4.43 R/Ro) and lower luminosity (32067.39 L/Lo) compared to Supergiants (51.15 R/Ro and 301816.25 L/Lo).\n5. Brown Dwarfs and Red Dwarfs have the highest average absolute magnitudes (17.56 and 12.54, respectively), meaning they are less bright.\n6. The most common star color and spectral class for Brown Dwarfs, Red Dwarfs, and Hypergiants are red and M.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on Red Dwarfs and Brown Dwarfs for further investigation. While they have relatively low temperatures and luminosities, these stars are known to have a longer lifespan, increasing the chance of habitable planet formation.\n2. Investigate further the relationship between star color and spectral class with the likelihood of habitable planets. This could provide additional insights for selecting target stars.\n3. Seek additional data on the presence of exoplanets and the habitability conditions around these star types, which can provide direct evidence for prioritizing certain star types to search for potential habitable planets."

Absolute magnitude has the highest negative correlation (-0.955) with star types, followed by Luminosity (0.677) and Radius (0.661), showing that these features have a strong relationship with the type of a star.\n3. Temperature has a moderate positive correlation (0.411) with star types, indicating it's also an important feature to consider.\n4. Star colors and spectral classes have different distributions among the star types, which implies that they are significant factors in identifying star types.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. Focus on developing telescope features that can accurately measure the four key continuous features: Absolute Magnitude, Luminosity, Radius, and Temperature, as they have a strong relationship with star types.\n2. Improve the telescope's capability to differentiate between various star colors and spectral classes, as they also play a significant role in star type identification.\n3. Additional research on the star types and their characteristics may be needed to improve the classification process further.\n4. Conduct more data collection and obtain a larger dataset for analysis to ensure that your model is based on accurate and diverse data, which will ultimately improve the telescope's performance in identifying star types."

The dataset contains 11 different star colors, with 'red' (46.7%), 'blue' (23.3%), and 'blue-white' (17.1%) being the most common.\n3. There are 7 different spectral classes ('A', 'B', 'F', 'G', 'K', 'M', and 'O') in the dataset, with the highest occurrence in class 'M' (46.3%) and the least in class 'G' (0.4%).\n4. Star types 0 and 1 are exclusively red and have spectral class 'M'.\n5. Star types 4 and 5 are mostly blue and red, with few exceptions in other colors. They also share similar spectral class distribution, with the highest occurrence in classes 'B' and 'M'.\n6. Star type 2 has a mix of colors, including white and blue-white, with spectral classes 'A', 'B', and 'F' being the most common.\n7. Star type 3 is mainly represented by blue-white and yellowish white colors, with spectral classes 'A', 'B', 'F', 'K', and 'O' distributed across these colors.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. For a more diverse stargazing experience, consider designing tours around star types 2 and 3, which have various colors and spectral classes.\n2. Focus on red stars (star types 0 and 1) for a unique tour experience centered around a single, visually striking color and spectral class 'M'.\n3. Since blue and red stars are common among star types 4 and 5, designing a tour around these categories could showcase the features of both colors and their corresponding spectral classes.\n4. Collaborate with experts in astronomy to further investigate specific unique features and the scientific significance of different star types, colors, and spectral classes.\n5. If possible, collect additional data to gain more insights into variables such as distance, prominence, and position in the sky, which can help in refining the stargazing experience for your tours."

The dataset contains 240 unique instances of stars, including both numerical and categorical features related to the star properties like temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star color, and spectral class.\n2. Temperature in the dataset ranges from 1939K to 40000K, with a mean of ~10497K and median of 5776K.\n3. Luminosity shows a wide distribution, with values between 0.00008 and 849420 (L/Lo), suggesting highly varying luminosity among stars.\n4. The radius of stars varies greatly, with a minimum value of 0.0084 and a maximum value of 1948.5 in the dataset (R/Ro).\n5. Star types are equally distributed in the dataset, with 40 instances for each of the six types (0 to 5).\n6. Star colors are majorly red (112 instances), blue (55 instances), and blue-white (26 instances), as well as many other variations, with a total of 19 unique colors.\n7. Spectral class distribution is prominent in M (111 instances) and B (46 instances) classes, among the seven unique spectral classes (A, B, F, G, K, M, O).\n8. The star properties display some strong relationships, such as high negative correlation between star type and absolute magnitude (-0.955), and positive correlation between star type and luminosity (0.677), and radius (0.661).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Update the textbook with information about the wide range of star temperatures and luminosities, highlighting the diversity of star properties in the universe.\n2. Expand the content on star colors, focusing on the most well-represented colors (red, blue, and blue-white) and mentioning others as more rare occurrences.\n3. Emphasize the prevalence of M and B spectral classes in the dataset while covering other classes, as they may also be of interest to readers.\n4. Include data-driven discussions about the relationship between star properties, such as the strong correlation between star type and absolute magnitude, and the positive correlations between star type, luminosity, and radius.\n\nPlease note that these findings and suggestions are based on the given dataset and may not conclusively cover all aspects of star types and properties. Additional data sources or expert knowledge in the field of astronomy should be considered to ensure a comprehensive understanding of stars in the textbook."

Based on the diverse range of star characteristics, you can write articles exploring various aspects like the relationship between star color, temperature, and luminosity, or differences between different spectral classes.\n2. Investigate further the inconsistencies in the Star color values, and consider standardizing these values to avoid confusion and provide a clearer classification of stars based on color.\n3. You could provide insights into the significance of star types and how they are related to other features in the dataset.\n4. Consider exploring the relationship between absolute magnitude and other factors, such as luminosity, radius, or temperature, to provide insights into how these factors are interconnected in determining the star types."

The dataset contains information on 240 stars, including temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star type, star color, and spectral class.\n2. The average temperature of the stars in the dataset is 10,497 K, with a range from 1,939 K to 40,000 K.\n3. Luminosity varies greatly among the stars, with the majority having low luminosity, while some have extremely high values.\n4. Stars in the dataset come in various colors, with Red being the most common (112 stars) and Blue (56 stars) and Blue-white (41 stars) following.\n5. The spectral class distribution shows that M-type stars are most common (111 stars), followed by B-type (46 stars) and O-type (40 stars).\n6. The correlation matrix indicates that the star type is strongly negatively correlated with the absolute magnitude (Mv) and positively correlated with luminosity and radius, meaning that as the star type increases, the absolute magnitude generally decreases, and both luminosity and radius increase.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Design activities targeting students' understanding of the relationship between star type, absolute magnitude (Mv), luminosity, and radius, as these variables show strong correlations.\n2. Create lesson plans focusing on star colors and spectral classes, such as using real examples from the dataset to illustrate each star type, color, and spectral class.\n3. Teach students about the wide-ranging temperatures and luminosities of stars, emphasizing the diversity in star properties.\n4. Incorporate data analysis techniques in the lessons to engage students in learning how scientists classify and analyze stars by studying their various properties.\n5. Develop group activities to help students explore the properties of stars within the dataset, encouraging critical thinking and collaborative problem-solving."

Temperature (in Kelvin) of stars ranges from 1939 to 40000, with the lowest temperatures found in star types 0 and 5, and the highest temperatures found in star types 4 and 5.\n3. Luminosity of stars greatly varies, with the highest values found in star types 4 and 5, suggesting they emit more energy.\n4. Radius (in solar radii) of stars also varies, with the largest stars found in star type 5 and the smallest in star types 2.\n5. Stars are predominantly red in color for star types 0 and 1, while blue and blue-white colors are more common in the other star types.\n6. Spectral classes are found to be specific to the star types, with type 0 and 1 stars belonging to class M, type 2 and 3 stars belonging to classes A, B, and F, and type 5 stars belonging to classes K, G, and M.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Star types 3 and 4, which have a mix of spectral classes, various colors, and high luminosities, would be interesting targets for research on the origins of the universe, as their wide range of properties might hold important clues.\n2. Consider investigating star types 0 and 5 for potential extraterrestrial life, due to their lower temperatures which might promote habitable conditions for life as we know it.\n3. Star type 2, with predominantly blue and blue-white colors, could also yield valuable insights into the early stages of star evolutions given their unique characteristics.\n4. Further research on other datasets can provide more information to strengthen the understanding of these star categories and aid in narrowing down the focus for promoting specific star types to the public."

Bitcoin has the lowest average rolling 30-day standard deviation among all cryptocurrencies, making it the most stable in terms of daily percentage price changes.\n2. Bitcoin Cash has the highest average rolling 30-day standard deviation, making it the most volatile currency.\n3. Binance Coin has the highest Sharpe ratio, which means it provides the best risk-adjusted return among all cryptocurrencies.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider including a larger allocation to Bitcoin in the portfolio since it is the most stable currency, which may help reduce overall portfolio volatility.\n2. Be cautious when investing in Bitcoin Cash due to its high volatility, which may result in significant fluctuations in the portfolio value.\n3. Prioritize investing in Binance Coin as it has the highest Sharpe ratio, indicating better risk-adjusted returns compared to other cryptocurrencies. This means that for a given level of risk, investing in Binance Coin is expected to provide better returns.\n4. Diversify the portfolio across multiple cryptocurrencies to mitigate the risk from potential declines in a single currency. This also allows the portfolio to benefit from different cryptocurrencies' unique characteristics and performance patterns.\n5. Continuously monitor market conditions, the performance of individual cryptocurrencies, and overall portfolio performance to adjust allocations when needed and maintain a balanced portfolio."

The top 5 cryptocurrencies with the highest average spread, a measure of the difference between the daily lowest and highest prices, are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin SV.\n3. The correlation matrix for daily returns shows that cryptocurrencies have different degrees of correlation with each other. For example, Binance Coin and EOS have a strong positive correlation of 0.82, while Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV have an almost zero correlation of 0.00.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider investing in the top 5 cryptocurrencies with the highest average daily returns, namely Bitcoin Cash, Tether, Tezos, Bitcoin SV, and Binance Coin, to potentially exploit price inefficiencies and maximize profits.\n2. Monitor cryptocurrencies with high average spread (e.g., Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin SV) to identify potential arbitrage opportunities and profit from the price differences during daily trading sessions.\n3. Diversify your investment portfolio by selecting cryptocurrencies with low or negative correlations, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, to mitigate risk and increase the stability of returns."

The cryptocurrency with the highest average daily price movement is Binance Coin (BNB), which shows more price fluctuations and potential opportunities for trading.\n2. The cryptocurrency with the lowest average daily price movement is Bitcoin (BTC), which is relatively more stable compared to other cryptocurrencies analyzed.\n3. The pair of cryptocurrencies with the highest correlation is Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA), meaning they tend to move in the same direction. This can be useful for diversifying the investment portfolio.\n4. The pair of cryptocurrencies with the lowest correlation is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Cardano (ADA), meaning they move more independently of each other, which can also be used for portfolio management strategies.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. If aiming for stability and lower market volatility, focus on improving the blockchain technology of Bitcoin (BTC), as it shows less daily price movement compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n2. For more opportunities in a fast-paced market, focus on Binance Coin (BNB) as it has the highest average daily price movement, allowing for more trading and investment chances.\n3. Considering the correlation of cryptocurrencies, diversify investments in Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Cardano (ADA) as their prices have low or no correlation, providing a potential hedge against market risks."

The top 3 countries with the highest number of objects in orbit are the US, PRC (China), and CIS (Russia).\n3. Mean motion, eccentricity, and inclination are crucial parameters that affect the risk of collision. Generally, higher mean motion, eccentricity, or inclination suggest a higher collision risk.\n4. Over time, there has been an increase in the number of objects launched into Earth's orbit. The more objects in orbit, the higher the risk of collisions.\n5. The average mean motion, eccentricity, and inclination have changed over time, indicating varying risks of collision depending on the launch year.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on tackling debris in orbit, as they constitute the majority of the objects and pose a higher risk of collision with satellites.\n2. Collaborate with major space-faring nations, such as the US, China, and Russia, to develop joint strategies for space debris removal, satellite tracking, and collision avoidance.\n3. Analyze the orbits of newly launched objects to maintain or improve the current mean motion, eccentricity, and inclination parameters that minimize the risk of collisions.\n4. Develop and implement collision avoidance technologies for new satellites to manage the increasing number of objects in orbit.\n5. Regularly monitor the mean motion, eccentricity, and inclination parameters of all objects in Earth's orbit to assess the risk of collisions and take preventive actions when necessary."

The majority of space debris originates from People's Republic of China (PRC) at 38.9%, followed by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) at 32.2% and the United States (US) at 24.0%.\n3. The years that contributed the most to space debris are 1999, 1993, 2000, 1997, and 1995, with 1999 being the year with the highest debris count (2759 objects).\n4. In general, space debris objects have mean motion around 12.95 orbits per day, inclination of 83.71 degrees, apogee altitude of 3850.76 km, and perigee altitude of 957.64 km.\n5. The size distribution of space debris is primarily small (89.8%), followed by medium (7.2%), and large (3.0%).\n6. Smaller debris tends to have higher orbital properties (inclination, mean motion, apogee, and perigee altitude) compared to medium and large debris.\n7. The rate of decay of space debris, represented by the mean motion dot, is higher for larger objects compared to smaller ones.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize the removal or mitigation of space debris generated by the countries that contribute the most to the problem (PRC, CIS, and US).\n2. Focus on periods with the highest debris count (e.g., 1999, 1993, and 2000), understanding the specific events or policies that led to the increase in space debris during those years, and develop strategies to prevent similar situations in the future.\n3. Target high-inclination, high-altitude space debris, as these objects are more likely to pose a collision risk for operational satellites, particularly those in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary Orbit (GEO).\n4. Develop mechanisms to remove or mitigate smaller space debris since they represent the majority (89.8%) of the debris population and have higher orbit properties.\n5. Prioritize the removal of larger debris objects with higher decay rates (higher mean motion dot) since they pose a more immediate risk of collision with operational spacecraft.\n6. Collaborate with international space agencies and governments to introduce policies and regulations that minimize the generation of new space debris, especially for countries with the highest contributions (PRC, CIS, and US)."

The majority of the objects are located in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), with 98.14% of debris, 85.21% of payloads, and 66.89% of rocket bodies concentrated in LEO.\n3. The market demand is heavily concentrated in LEO (85.21%), followed by Medium Earth Orbit (MEO, 13.13%), Geostationary Orbit (GEO, 1.64%), and High Earth Orbit (HEO, 0.02%).\n4. The top countries in terms of satellite launches are the US (2,772), PRC (China, 457), UK (391), CIS (Russia, 272), and Japan (116).\n5. The market demand trend over the years shows a general increase, with a notable spike in 2021 (1,442 launches compared to 1,125 in 2020).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Due to the high concentration of objects in LEO and the strong market demand in that orbit, it is recommended to focus on providing satellite services for Low Earth Orbit.\n2. Since the US, China, UK, and Russia dominate the market in terms of satellite launches, it would be prudent to target these countries as primary clients for your satellite services.\n3. Medium Earth Orbit also has a considerable demand (13.13%) and could be a secondary target for your satellite services.\n4. Keep an eye on the market demand trend for any significant changes in the future and be prepared to adjust the focus of your satellite services accordingly.\n5. Investigate the specific needs and requirements of satellites in LEO related to the services you can provide, such as communication, navigation, or Earth observation, to better tailor your services to the needs of your clients."

The top 10 most common ages for objects in the dataset are between 2 years and 26 years, with a maximum count of 2759 objects at 24 years old.\n3. The overall failure rate of objects in the dataset is 63.67%.\n4. The failure rates vary substantially depending on the launch year, with rates reaching 100% in some years (e.g., 1961, 1981) and as low as 3.48% in 2021.\n5. The top satellite-producing countries are the United States, China, Russia (CIS), the United Kingdom, France, India, Japan, the European Space Agency (ESA), and Germany. The failure rates of objects from these countries can vary greatly, from 0% in Germany, the UK, and TBD to 91.41% in Russia (CIS).\n6. Older satellites have a higher likelihood of failure, with a 100% failure rate for objects aged 30 years or older.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider focusing on designing satellites with a lifespan of 20-30 years, as most objects still remain in orbit within that age range, and there is a significant drop in function after that period.\n2. For the development of new satellite models, investigate the factors that contributed to the lower failure rates in more recent years (e.g., improved technology, stricter regulations) and apply those findings to improve the longevity and reliability of your products.\n3. Analyze the designs and materials of satellite models from countries with lower failure rates (e.g., Germany, UK) to learn from their best practices and incorporate them into your manufacturing process.\n4. Improve monitoring and maintenance processes for older satellites (i.e., older than 20 years), as these objects have a significantly higher chance of failure.\n5. Collaborate with international partners and regulatory bodies to develop and implement guidelines and best practices that minimize the potential for satellite failures, debris generation, and congestion in Earth's orbit."

United States (34.6%), China (27.7%), and countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States (22.6%) are the primary countries responsible for the objects in Earth's orbit.\n3. There has been a steady increase in the number of objects launched into Earth's orbit since the 1960s, with the highest number of objects being launched in recent years (2019-2021).\n4. In terms of RCS_SIZE, most of the objects in Earth's orbit are small (58.9%); however, there's still a significant number of large objects (29.6%).\n5. Debris and rocket bodies have notably higher eccentricities on average compared to payloads and TBA objects, suggesting greater variation in their orbit shapes.\n6. The inclinations of objects also show significant differences based on the type, with debris and TBA objects having higher inclination values compared to payloads and rocket bodies.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Develop regulations to limit the creation of new debris in space, focusing on countries and organizations, particularly in the US, China, and CIS, responsible for most of the launches.\n2. Set guidelines for satellite operators on controlling and disposing of their payloads and rocket bodies after their operational lives to minimize the creation of new debris.\n3. Encourage satellite operators to use specific orbits with lower congestion and likelihood of collisions, based on the analysed inclinations and eccentricities.\n4. Promote the use of technology to mitigate existing debris, including active debris removal systems, and invest in research to enhance such technologies.\n5. Advocate for international cooperation on space activities and debris mitigation, involving major countries in the space industry, to collectively ensure sustainable use of Earth's orbit.\n6. Regularly update and monitor the database of satellites and debris in Earth's orbit to track progress on debris management and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented regulations."

Customers with a voice mail plan have a lower churn rate (9%) compared to those without a voice mail plan (17%).\n4. Churned customers tend to have higher usage of day, evening, and night minutes, as well as more total international minutes, compared to non-churned customers.\n5. Churned customers on average have slightly fewer international calls than non-churned customers.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the reasons for customer service calls with 4 or more instances and take appropriate actions to address these issues, which could potentially help in decreasing the churn rate.\n2. Improve the international plan offerings or customer support related to the international plan, to reduce the churn rate among customers with an international plan.\n3. Encourage customers without a voice mail plan to consider opting for one, as these customers have a higher churn rate, and the plan seems to be associated with better customer satisfaction.\n4. Monitor high usage customers, especially for day, evening, night, and international minutes, and consider offering tailored plans or promotions to improve customer satisfaction and minimize churn.\n5. Although churned customers have fewer international calls, they use more international minutes. Examine the quality and pricing of international calls to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn rate."

Improve customer service quality and efficiency to reduce the number of calls required to resolve customer issues and thus reduce churn.\n2. Reassess international plans to ensure customer satisfaction while maintaining competitive pricing, as it seems to have a higher churn rate compared to customers on regular plans.\n3. Consider promoting voice mail plans to customers, as it is associated with a lower churn rate.\n4. Monitor usage patterns, in particular total day minutes and total day charges, to identify customers with a higher risk of churning and proactively engage with them to improve their experience or offer personalized deals.\n5. Conduct further investigation into the reasons for customer complaints and address the root causes to reduce the overall number of customer service calls and, in turn, reduce churn."

The average age of high-risk pregnancy patients is 36.2 years, while the average age of low-risk pregnancy patients is 26.9 years. The t-test confirms a significant difference between the two groups (p-value < 0.00001).\n2. Systolic Blood Pressure: High-risk pregnancies have a higher average systolic blood pressure (124.2 mmHg) than low-risk pregnancies (105.9 mmHg). The t-test shows a significant difference between the groups (p-value < 0.00001).\n3. Diastolic Blood Pressure: High-risk pregnancies are associated with higher diastolic blood pressure (85.1 mmHg) compared to low-risk pregnancies (72.5 mmHg). The t-test confirms a significant difference (p-value < 0.00001).\n4. Blood Sugar: High blood sugar levels are more common in high-risk pregnancies (average 12.1) than low-risk pregnancies (average 7.2). The t-test reveals a significant difference between the two groups (p-value < 0.00001).\n5. Body Temperature: High-risk pregnancy patients have a slightly higher average body temperature (98.9\u00b0F) than low-risk pregnancy patients (98.4\u00b0F). The t-test confirms this difference is significant (p-value < 0.00001).\n6. Heart Rate: A higher heart rate is observed in high-risk pregnancies (average 76.7 bpm) compared to low-risk pregnancies (average 72.8 bpm). The t-test shows a significant difference between the groups (p-value < 0.00001).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Monitor and manage blood pressure and blood sugar levels closely in pregnant patients, as these factors are significantly correlated with high-risk pregnancies.\n2. Pay closer attention to older pregnant patients, as age is a significant factor contributing to high-risk pregnancies.\n3. Maintain regular check-ups with patients to monitor their body temperature and heart rate, as these factors may also influence pregnancy risk levels.\n4. Encourage patients to maintain a healthy lifestyle and proper prenatal care to help reduce risk factors that can lead to high-risk pregnancies.\n5. Further research should be conducted to better understand the interplay of these factors and potentially identify other factors that could also contribute to high-risk pregnancies."

The mean values for SystolicBP and DiastolicBP were significantly higher in the high risk group compared to the low and mid risk groups.

Develop new medications targeting blood pressure regulation, specifically focusing on Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure, as these attributes show a strong association with the risk level.\n2. Investigate the potential for developing medications or interventions focused on managing blood sugar and/or supporting optimal insulin function, as blood sugar levels also showed differences across risk groups.\n3.

The Maternal Health Risk Data Set contains information on Age, Systolic Blood Pressure (SystolicBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DiastolicBP), Blood Sugar (BS), Body Temperature (BodyTemp), Heart Rate, and Risk Levels (high risk, mid risk, and low risk).\n2. Approximately 40% of the individuals in the data set are categorized as low risk, 33% as mid risk, and 27% as high risk.\n3. The mean values of continuous variables (Age, SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, BS, BodyTemp, and HeartRate) vary significantly between different RiskLevel groups. For example, the average age of high risk individuals is 36.22 years, while low risk individuals are on average 26.87 years old.\n4. The correlations between continuous variables reveal some noteworthy associations, such as a strong positive correlation between SystolicBP and DiastolicBP (0.79), and a moderate positive correlation between Age and Blood Sugar (0.47).\n5. The distribution of risk levels across age ranges and blood sugar ranges shows that younger individuals (10-29 years) are more likely to be at low or mid risk, whereas individuals aged 30-59 are more likely to be at high risk. Blood sugar range of 7-7.9 has the highest number of low risk individuals, while a blood sugar range of 15-15.9 has the highest number of high risk individuals.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Allocate resources to target high-risk individuals, focusing on those aged 30-59 and with high blood sugar levels (above 15).\n2. Implement prevention programs targeting younger individuals (10-29 years) to maintain their low-mid risk status by educating them on the importance of maintaining healthy blood pressure and blood sugar levels.\n3. Provide support and intervention programs for individuals with high systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as these factors show strong correlation and are positively associated with higher risk levels.\n4. Consider introducing health monitoring measures to regularly track individuals' blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and blood sugar levels, allowing for early detection of high-risk individuals and facilitating timely interventions.\n5. Evaluate the impact of allocated resources and intervention programs periodically to fine-tune policies and ensure the effectiveness of efforts in improving maternal health outcomes."

The dataset consists of 1,014 records, with each record containing information on age, SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, BS (Blood Sugar), BodyTemp, HeartRate, and RiskLevel (high risk, mid risk, low risk).\n2. High risk cases make up 26.82% of the data, mid risk cases make up 33.14%, and low risk cases make up 40.04%.\n3. Older age, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and higher body temperature are associated with higher maternal health risk levels.\n4. There is a significant relationship between risk level and different age groups, systolic blood pressure groups, diastolic blood pressure groups, and blood sugar groups.\n5. No significant relationship was found between risk levels and heart rates.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Develop educational materials and training programs that specifically target high-risk women, particularly those who are older, have high blood pressure, or have elevated blood sugar levels.\n2. Create separate modules for healthcare professionals to counsel patients on maintaining healthy blood pressure and blood sugar levels to minimize the risk of maternal health issues.\n3. Incorporate information on the importance of monitoring patients' body temperature during pregnancy, as high body temperatures are also associated with increased maternal health risk.\n4. Encourage healthcare professionals to educate patients and their families on the importance of regular prenatal checkups and monitoring blood pressure, blood sugar, and body temperature throughout pregnancy.\n5. Since heart rate was not found to have a significant relationship with maternal health risk levels in this dataset, you may consider focusing more on the other factors (age, blood pressure, blood sugar, and body temperature) when developing your educational materials and training programs. However, note that this does not mean heart rate is unimportant, and it should still be monitored in standard prenatal care."

Average prices for each product vary slightly across cities, indicating potential differences in pricing strategies based on geographical locations.\n3. The total number of sales is highest in Athens, followed by Patra, Thessaloniki, Irakleion, and Larisa.\n4. Price elasticity of demand is -1 for all products, suggesting that a 1% increase in price would result in a 1% decrease in quantity demanded.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on promoting and optimizing prices for high-revenue products, such as Adult-Cola, Orange-Power, and Kinder-Cola in their 1.5lt plastic containers.\n2. Investigate the reasons behind variations in pricing across different cities and consider implementing more consistent pricing strategies or further segmentation of markets based on local factors.\n3. Focus marketing efforts on cities with higher sales potential, such as Athens, Patra, and Thessaloniki.\n4. Since the price elasticity of demand is -1 for all products, it indicates that the products are in the \"unitary elastic\" category. This means that optimal pricing would occur when the percentage change in price does not affect total revenue, i.e., price changes do not lead to significant gains or losses in revenue. Therefore, focus on non-price factors such as improving product quality, enhancing distribution networks, and targeted marketing campaigns to increase overall sales and market share."

Consider focusing on promoting the top-selling stores (Shop 6, Shop 4, and Shop 2) in the marketing strategy, as they have the highest revenue generation.\n2. Investigate the reasons for the lower revenue in kinder-cola brand, and consider adjusting the pricing or marketing strategy to improve its performance.\n3. Analyze the sales trends for different container types and capacities to identify the optimal mix to focus on, as prices vary by container type.\n4. Run promotions or discounts on products with lower revenue to increase the overall sales quantity, as quantity sold has a strong impact on revenue.\n5. Conduct more in-depth analysis of factors affecting sales quantity and customer preferences in terms of brands, container types, and pricing.\n6. Continuously monitor sales data and revise financial plans according to the insights gained from the analysis. If necessary, adjust marketing and pricing strategies to maximize revenue."

Plastic containers also have the highest average price, followed by glass and cans.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus marketing efforts on the top-performing brands, Adult-cola and Orange-power, while considering potential improvements (price, promotion) for lower-performing brands like Kinder-cola.\n2. Investigate the possible reasons for seasonal patterns in sales and cater marketing campaigns accordingly, with potential emphasis on specific brands during high-sales periods.\n3. Explore the reasons behind the varying sales per capita across cities and develop city-specific marketing campaigns to address those factors and improve sales in underperforming locations.\n4. Consider promoting and expanding the availability of plastic containers, given their high sales and market share, while investigating the preferences for glass and cans to potentially improve their market performance.\n5. Continuously monitor and analyze the market trends and consumer preferences to update and adjust marketing campaigns as needed."

The dataset contains information on fruit and vegetable prices from June 2013 onwards, with the average price for each commodity provided for each recorded date.\n2. We observed noticeable price inflation in several commodities, like Drumstick, Sweet Orange, Jack Fruit, Okra, Christophine, and Guava.\n3. Based on our analysis, the top 5 commodities with the highest price inflation are Christophine (317%), Guava (256%), Drumstick (251%), Jack Fruit (183%), and Bottle Gourd (176%).\n4. The overall average inflation across all commodities is 33.66%.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on the commodities with the highest price inflation for possible interventions, as they might have the most significant impact on consumers and prices.\n2. Investigate the factors contributing to high inflation in these particular commodities, like supply chain issues, production costs, or market demand changes, and address them with targeted policies or incentives to counteract price inflation.\n3. Monitor the price trends of other commodities as well, even if they are not currently experiencing high inflation, to detect any emerging trends early and respond accordingly.\n4. Encourage alternative sources of supply (e.g., imports from other countries or promoting local cultivation) for critical commodities with lasting high inflation to ensure food price stability and reduce the burden on consumers."

The average prices of commodities in the dataset range from 10 to 423, with most expensive items being Strawberry, Mushroom(Button), Lime, Asparagus, and Kiwi.\n3. The least expensive items are Maize, Raddish White(Local), Cauli Terai, Cabbage(Local), and Potato White.\n4. There are seasonal variations and long-term price trends for the top 5 most and least expensive commodities.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Encourage clients to incorporate more of the least expensive fruits and vegetables (Maize, Raddish White(Local), Cauli Terai, Cabbage(Local), and Potato White) into their diets, as they provide a more affordable way to maintain a healthy and balanced diet.\n2. For those who prefer more expensive items like Strawberry, Mushroom(Button), Lime, Asparagus, and Kiwi, advise them to consume these commodities during seasons when their prices are lower, or consider finding substitutes with similar nutritional values but at a lower cost.\n3. Continuously monitor price trends and seasonal variations for the selected fruits and vegetables and adjust recommendations as needed, considering both the affordability and nutritional value of the commodities.\n4. Collaborate with local farmers' markets and grocery stores to create affordable and healthy meal plans based on the current prices and availability of fruits and vegetables in your area."

The bottom 5 commodities with the lowest average prices are Maize, Raddish White(Local), Cauli Terai, Cabbage(Local), and Potato White.\n3. The mean prices of fruits and vegetables have generally increased over the years, with a significant jump between 2016 and 2019.\n4. The seasonality has an impact on mean prices, where Autumn has the highest average prices, and Winter has the lowest average prices. The price difference, however, is not very significant between seasons.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider planting fruits and vegetables with the highest average prices like Strawberry, Mushroom(Button), Lime, Asparagus, and Kiwi to maximize profits.\n2. Keep an eye on seasonality trends, and plan your harvest accordingly to take advantage of higher prices during Autumn and avoid the lower prices in Winter.\n3. Be prepared for potential fluctuations in prices over the years due to various factors, such as climate changes, supply and demand, or market conditions.\n4. Since the analysis is based on historical data, it's important to regularly update your database and re-evaluate the findings to ensure your decisions are based on current trends."

There is a weak positive correlation between the number of pirate attacks and factors such as total_fisheries_per_ton, total_military, and population, while there is a weak negative correlation with factors like GDP, unemployment_rate, and totalgr.\n3. The number of pirate attacks has fluctuated over the years, with Indonesia consistently having the highest number of attacks.\n4. Attack types have different distributions. For instance, hijackings are more common in the early 1990s, attempted attacks and boardings in the early 2000s, and fired upon incidents in the late 2000s.\n5. The average shore distance for each attack type varies, with explosions occurring closest to the shore (around 1 km) and hijackings farthest from the shore (around 70 km).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus anti-piracy efforts on high-risk countries and their coastal areas, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, and Yemen.\n2. Monitor and regulate fishing activities in regions with high piracy rates, as a higher tonnage of fishery production could be related to an increased number of attacks.\n3. Engage with the governments of high-risk countries to strengthen their maritime law enforcement and coordinate joint anti-piracy operations.\n4. Adjust anti-piracy policies based on the dominant attack type in a specific time period or region, such as deploying quicker response teams for incidents closer to the shore (explosions) or placing more resources for incidents farther from the shore (hijackings).\n5. Address social and economic factors in high-risk countries, such as unemployment and poverty, which could potentially drive individuals towards maritime piracy. Collaborate with regional governments to develop sustainable livelihood alternatives for coastal communities."

Over the period of 1993-2020, the most affected region by pirate attacks was East Asia & Pacific, accounting for 43.51% of total attacks, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa with 20.99% and South Asia with 13.01%.\n2. The number of pirate attacks per year peaked in 2010, with a total of 366 reported incidents.\n3. Hijacking incidents made up a significant portion of attacks in the Middle East & North Africa (14.29%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (11.47%), while attempted and successful boarding were more common in East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, and South Asia.\n4. There is no strong correlation between a country's economic indicators (GDP, fisheries, military, etc.) and the number of pirate attacks occurring in their waters. However, there is some positive relationship between attacks and fisheries, military, population, and the industry share of GDP.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Due to the high risk of pirate attacks in East Asia & Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia, consider rerouting or increasing security measures for shipping routes passing through these regions.\n2. Increase the monitoring and situational awareness of vessels traveling through the Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, as hijacking is more prevalent in those regions.\n3. Evaluate and invest in security measures to protect vessels during boarding or attempted boarding situations, as this type of attack is common across most regions.\n4. Stay informed about the economic conditions and industries in countries along shipping routes, as changes in fisheries activity, military forces, population, and the prevalence of industries may affect the risk of pirate attacks."

Indonesia is the country with the highest number of pirate attacks overall and specifically for boarding, while Yemen has the highest number for attempted boarding and hijacking.\n3. Pirate attacks peaked in the year 2000 with 462 incidents and were lowest in 1994 with only 5 incidents.\n4. The average yearly number of pirate attacks is 257.\n5. Countries with a higher concentration of attacks include: Indonesia, Yemen, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Nigeria, India, Somalia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Brazil.\n6. The average shore distance for attacks varies by attack type: hijackings often occur farther from the coast (70.84 km), while boardings and attempted boardings occur closer to the coast (16.87 km and 62.43 km, respectively).\n7. In general, there have been upward trends in global GDP, total fisheries production, total military personnel, and population, while unemployment rates have slightly decreased over time.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Advise shipping companies and governments in the top 10 countries with the highest number of attacks to invest in improved maritime security, including better communication systems, surveillance, and patrol vessels.\n2. Shipping companies should implement onboard security measures for vessels in high-risk areas, such as having armed security teams, installing security cameras, and implementing lock-down procedures.\n3. Encourage international cooperation in combating piracy, such as information sharing and joint law enforcement efforts in the regions with high pirate activity.\n4. Since hijackings often occur farther from the coast, recommend vessels maintain a safe distance from the shoreline (approximately 100 km) when transiting through high-risk regions.\n5. Suggest that governments in high-risk areas invest in capacity building for coastal communities, such as by providing alternative livelihood opportunities and educational programs, to reduce the socioeconomic drivers of piracy.\n6. Advocate for a continued focus on decreasing unemployment rates, as this trend could potentially lead to a reduction in pirate attacks in the long run.\n\nIt is important to note that the data does not guarantee cause and effect relationships between factors like country indicators, shore distance, and attack types. The suggestions are based on observed patterns and trends in the data."

The number of pirate attacks varies significantly across countries and years, with some regions experiencing a higher number of attacks than others.\n2. The region with the highest average number of pirate attacks is the Middle East & North Africa, followed by East Asia & Pacific and South Asia.\n3. The top three factors that show a positive correlation with the number of pirate attacks are total fisheries per ton, population, and industry of GDP.\n4. Countries with higher total fisheries per ton, larger populations, and higher industries of GDP tend to experience more pirate attacks on average.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus further research on the Middle East & North Africa, East Asia & Pacific, and South Asia regions, as these regions show a relatively higher number of pirate attacks.\n2. Investigate the role of total fisheries per ton in fostering pirate attacks, as it may suggest competition for resources or potential targets for pirate groups.\n3. Explore the relationship between population and pirate attacks, as a higher population might indicate a higher likelihood of maritime activities and potential targets.\n4. Analyze the impact of industry of GDP on pirate attacks, as it may show a connection to economic development, infrastructure, and specific industries that could be targeted by pirates."

Europe & Central Asia and North America have the lowest risk of pirate attacks.\n3. The majority of attacks occur closer to the shore, suggesting that ships farther from the coast might have a lower risk of pirate attacks in general.\n4. The most common type of attack is boarding. Hijacking is less frequent but poses a significant risk in certain regions, such as the Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n5. Vessels at anchor or berthed tend to be more prone to pirate attacks than those in motion.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider prioritizing cruise routes in regions with a lower risk of pirate attacks, such as Europe & Central Asia and North America.\n2. Avoid cruise routes that are closer to the coastal areas with a high risk of pirate attacks, particularly in East Asia & Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia.\n3. Implement security measures to protect vessels at anchor or berthed, as these are more likely to be targeted by pirates.\n4. Monitor the geopolitical situation and consult maritime security updates to stay informed about potential threats and risks in the regions where you operate.\n5. Implement security measures and protocols, such as hiring security teams or having emergency response plans in place, for sailing in higher-risk regions."

Since suicide rates are decreasing across all regions, further analysis could be performed to identify specific factors contributing to these declines and explore their correlation with suicide rates.\n2. Focus on countries within the regions with the highest average suicide rates (Africa, Western Pacific, and Europe) to better understand the underlying causes of high suicide rates and develop targeted prevention strategies.\n3. Analyze the data at the country level to identify outliers or countries with unique trends, as these may provide insights into the effectiveness of specific policies or interventions in reducing suicide rates.\n4.

Africa has the highest average suicide rate (16.64) among the regions studied, and Eastern Mediterranean had the lowest (6.24).\n4. Lesotho had the highest average suicide rate among countries (77.50) between 2000 and 2019.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on the most vulnerable regions, such as Africa, which has the highest average suicide rate.\n2. Prioritize male-targeted suicide prevention strategies, as males have significantly higher suicide rates than females (on average 3.47 times higher).\n3. Collaborate with organizations and experts in countries with the highest average suicide rates like Lesotho, Eswatini, and Guyana to identify the key factors contributing to high suicide rates.\n4. Look into successful strategies adopted by countries with low suicide rates to see if those strategies can be adapted and implemented in the vulnerable regions and communities to help lower suicide rates.\n5. Implement awareness campaigns and mental health support efforts that target the diverse factors contributing to suicide, such as financial stress, mental illness, and substance use problems."

Between 2000 and 2019, the global average suicide rate for both sexes decreased by 3.15, with the male suicide rate decreasing by 4.90 and the female suicide rate decreasing by 1.64.\n2. The top 10 countries with the highest average suicide rates between 2000 and 2019 include six countries from Africa, three from Europe, and one from the Americas. Lesotho in Africa had the highest average suicide rate overall.\n3. Trends in suicide rates for the top 5 countries with the highest average suicide rates show varying patterns \u2013 some countries had consistently high rates, while others experienced increases or decreases over time.\n4. There is a strong positive correlation (0.99) between male and female suicide rates across years, indicating that as male suicide rates increase or decrease, so do female suicide rates.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Lobby for increased funding for suicide prevention programs, focusing on countries with the highest average suicide rates, such as Lesotho, Eswatini, Guyana, Russian Federation, and Botswana.\n2. Investigate and promote evidence-based prevention strategies that have proven to be successful in countries where suicide rates have decreased over time.\n3. Address differences in prevention strategies for both sexes, while recognizing the strong correlation between male and female suicide rates, suggesting that some interventions may be effective for both groups.\n4. Regularly monitor and analyze trends in suicide rates worldwide to identify emerging patterns or additional countries in need of targeted suicide prevention efforts."

The analysis of sales data by date showed that the highest total sales occurred on 2011-04-04.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on promoting or offering promotions for high sales items such as \"Manual,\" \"DOTCOM POSTAGE,\" and \"POSTAGE\" to further increase sales.\n2. For items with high average quantity purchases, consider offering bundles or special deals to encourage bulk buying and attract more customers.\n3. Investigate whether the high average-priced items are attracting enough customers, and consider promotional pricing or discounts to potentially increase sales in that segment.\n4. Develop loyalty programs or special offers for the top customers to strengthen their loyalty and encourage them to continue purchasing.\n5. Expand marketing and promotional efforts in countries with high sales such as the United Kingdom, Singapore, Germany, France, and Spain. Additionally, explore opportunities to increase sales in other countries with lower sales.\n6. Monitor sales trends over time to identify any specific periods or events that generate more sales; this can help with targeted marketing or promotions."

The correlation coefficient between price percentile rank and average revenue per transaction is 0.1744, indicating a weak positive relationship.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider increasing the price for items with high average revenue per transaction but low price percentile rank. These products may have a higher demand and can potentially generate more revenue.\n2. Analyze factors that affect sales, such as seasonality or promotions, to identify the most effective pricing strategy for each item.\n3. For items with a high number of transactions but low average revenue per transaction, consider bundling them with other complementary products to boost revenue.\n4. Continuously monitor the sales performance of each item, and adjust prices as needed based on factors such as market conditions, competition, and customer preferences."

The dataset contains information on 62 Apple iPhone products with varying sale prices, discounts, ratings, and reviews.\n2. iPhone models have 2 GB, 3 GB, 4 GB, and 6 GB RAM options, with the majority of the products having 4 GB RAM (29 products). The average sale price increases with the amount of RAM.\n3. The average star rating for all products is 4.57, showing generally high customer satisfaction.\n4. There is a significant negative correlation between sale price and number of ratings/reviews, indicating that cheaper products tend to have more ratings and reviews.\n5. The top 5 products with the highest number of ratings have an average sale price of $34,999, a 22% discount, and a 4.5 star rating, compared to the rest of the products with an average sale price of $84,027.82, an 8.89% discount, and a 4.58 star rating.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus marketing campaigns on products with lower sale prices, as they tend to attract more ratings and reviews, which might indicate higher demand.\n2. Consider offering higher discounts on premium products (higher RAM and sale price) to increase their attractiveness to customers and potentially boost their sales.\n3. Monitor and improve the customer experience for all products, as higher star ratings can help attract new customers and retain existing ones.\n4. Analyze the impact of specific marketing campaigns on the number of ratings and reviews for each product to further tailor marketing strategies.\n5. Conduct regular competitor analysis to stay ahead in the market and adjust pricing and marketing campaigns accordingly."

A strong negative correlation (-0.57) exists between the discount percentage and sale price, indicating that higher discounts result in a decrease in the sale price.\n3. A moderate positive correlation (0.68) is present between the discount percentage and the number of ratings, as well as between the discount percentage and the number of reviews (0.69). This suggests a higher discount attracts more ratings and reviews.\n4. There is a weak negative correlation (-0.35) between the discount percentage and the star rating, signifying that higher discounts may lead to a slight decrease in the star rating.\n5. Discounts of 0%, 10%, 15%, and 17% correspond to high sales (greater than $75,000) and high star ratings (greater than or equal to 4.6), but none of them have high review counts (greater than 4,000).\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. Consider offering discounts within the range of 0%, 10%, 15%, and 17% as these provide the highest sales while maintaining a high star rating.\n2. Implement targeted marketing and promotions to encourage more customer reviews, which may contribute to higher sales for products with discounts corresponding to optimal sales and star ratings.\n3. Explore offering new discounts that stimulate higher review and rating counts while preserving the high sales revenue. Monitoring these factors continuously is necessary to ensure optimal pricing strategies are maintained.\n4. Keep in mind that offering discounts may lead to a slight decrease in star ratings; thus, maintaining product quality and customer satisfaction should also be prioritized."

The average discount percentage offered is around 9.95% with a median discount of 10%.\n3. The average number of ratings for the iPhones in the dataset is 22,420, with a median of 2,101 ratings.\n4. The average star rating for the iPhones is 4.58, with a median star rating of 4.60.\n5. There is a negative correlation between sale price and the number of ratings (-0.70), indicating that as the price increases, the number of ratings generally decreases.\n6. There is also a negative correlation between sale price and discount percentage (-0.57). This suggests that more expensive models may come with smaller discounts.\n7. The top-rated iPhone models (with the highest star ratings) are mostly iPhone 11 Pro Max models.\n8. The iPhone models that receive the highest number of ratings are iPhone SE models with various storage capacities and colors.\n9. The top 5 discounted iPhone models have discounts ranging from 22% to 29%, and these primarily include iPhone SE and iPhone 11 Pro models.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Monitor the sales and customer reviews of the iPhone 11 Pro Max models, as they generally have the highest star ratings.\n2. Investigate if there are any specific features or attributes of the iPhone SE models that make them more popular in terms of the number of ratings received, as it might help in addressing the customer complaints more effectively.\n3. Offer more discounts on expensive models, as the data shows a negative correlation between sale price and discount percentage, which could encourage more customers to purchase high-priced models and generate more reviews.\n4. Keep an eye on the iPhone models with the highest discounts, as this might lead to increased sales and, in turn, more customer reviews to analyze the potential issues.\n5. Encourage more customers to leave reviews for the iPhone models that are not so popular in terms of the number of ratings, as it will provide a more balanced understanding of the various issues customers might be facing across different models."

This suggests that animals with longer gestation times, higher exposure to danger while sleeping, and higher predation risk tend to sleep less.\n2. The mean sleep duration across all animals is about 10.53 hours, with a median value of 10.45 hours. However, the standard deviation is 4.45 hours, indicating a wide range of sleep durations among different species.\n3. Animals with a higher danger index have shorter sleep durations on average, with the average sleep duration dropping from 12.94 hours for animals with a danger index of 1 to 5.49 hours for animals with a danger index of 5.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus further research on the factors that are most strongly correlated with sleep duration, such as gestation time, sleep exposure index, and danger index, to better understand the patterns and causality of sleep duration in different animal species.\n2. Investigate the biological and environmental reasons behind the observed relationships between sleep duration and the identified factors to improve our understanding of sleep patterns in the animal kingdom.\n3. Consider collecting and incorporating additional data on the animals' habitat, lifestyle, and behavior to further strengthen the analysis and potentially uncover new patterns and relationships related to sleep duration."

The average total sleep time across all animal species in the dataset is 10.53 hours, with a standard deviation of 4.61 hours, indicating a wide variation in sleep patterns among different species.\n2. There is a moderate negative correlation between total sleep time and factors such as body weight, brain weight, maximum life span, and gestation time.\n3. Animals with higher predation, sleep exposure, and danger indexes tend to sleep less on average compared to those with lower indexes.\n   - High predation index animals sleep 8.43 hours on average, while low predation index animals sleep 11.56 hours on average.\n   - High sleep exposure index animals sleep 6.37 hours on average, while low sleep exposure index animals sleep 11.99 hours on average.\n   - High danger index animals sleep 6.74 hours on average, while low danger index animals sleep 11.98 hours on average.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on animals with extreme total sleep times (both long and short) to provide interesting insights into sleep pattern variations and their possible evolutionary reasons.\n2. When writing articles about sleep patterns in different species, emphasize the impact of predation and danger indexes on sleep time, as these factors seem to greatly influence the amount of sleep an animal gets.\n3. Investigate further into the evolutionary and ecological factors that may explain the negative correlations between body weight, brain weight, maximum life span, gestation time, and total sleep time in animals.\n4. Consider discussing the sleep patterns of animals with interesting biological characteristics, such as specific reproductive strategies, unique habitats, or dietary habits to engage a general audience and promote curiosity in the topic."

The average nutritional values vary across the menu items, with energy ranging from 85.73 to 832.67 kcal, protein from 1.54 to 47.60g, total fat from 1.77 to 46.90g, carbs from 10.50 to 117.78g, and sodium from 34.51 to 1854.71mg.\n2. The most common allergens in the menu items are cereal containing gluten, milk, and soy, which affect more than 38% of items.\n3. The menu items are grouped under different tags, with some tags having similar average nutritional values. For example, items with the tag \"Each bite is better than the last\" share higher protein and total fat.\n4. There are strong positive correlations between energy, protein, total fat, and sodium, indicating that items with higher values in one of these nutrients tend to also have higher values in the others.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. While creating new menu items, consider addressing a wide range of nutritional value preferences to cater to different customer needs.\n2. Be mindful of the common allergens present in the menu and consider offering alternatives or clearly labeling these allergens to help customers with dietary restrictions.\n3. Leverage the popular tags in existing menu items when designing new items, but also try to innovate by experimenting with unique tags and combinations, as they may reveal hidden customer preferences.\n4. Since there are strong positive correlations between various nutritional values, it is advised to consider balanced menu items where high protein, total fat, or sodium content is offset by lower values in other nutrients. This approach can address the needs of health-conscious customers while still offering delicious options."

        "content": "## Final report\n### Findings\n1. The average energy, protein, fat, and sugar content vary greatly across different food categories, with some categories having significantly higher or lower values than others.\n2. There are strong correlations between energy and protein, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium, suggesting that foods with higher energy content tend to also be high in those nutrients.\n3. Foods with high protein contents also tend to have high amounts of cholesterol and sodium.\n4. The top 3 food items with the highest nutrient values are not always in the same category, implying that the \"healthiest\" and \"unhealthiest\" choices span across various food offerings at McDonald's.\n5. Conversely, the food items with the lowest nutrient values are also not always in the same category, indicating that there are healthier options available in most categories.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the ingredients used in dishes with high energy, fat, sodium, and sugar levels to identify areas for improvement in terms of health standards and nutritional value.\n2. Consider reducing the portion sizes or modifying the recipes of the food items with the highest nutrient values in order to offer more balanced and healthy options.\n3. Encourage customers to choose healthier options by promoting the food items with lower nutrient values or introducing new, healthier menu items in each category.\n4. Review the preparation methods for high-cholesterol and high-sodium dishes to ensure compliance with health guidelines and identify potential areas for improvement.\n5. Continuously monitor and update the nutritional information of all menu items to maintain transparency with customers and to ensure adherence to food safety and health standards."

Menu items have a wide range of energy content, with some (including Chicken Maharaja Mac\u00ae, Chicken McNuggets\u00ae, and Veg Maharaja Mac\u00ae) having high energy content, and others (McFlurry Choco Crunch\u00ae, Soft Serve Cone\u00ae, and Strawberry Sundae\u00ae) having relatively low energy content.\n3. The most common categories (tags) are \"Each bite is better than the last\" and \"Burgers aren't the only things we're good at,\" followed by \"The legend among legends\" and \"Dil se makhani burger.\"\n4. Common allergens include milk (80.56% of menu items), cereal containing gluten (72.22%), and soya (61.11%).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on high-demand menu items with unique selling points, such as Chicken Maharaja Mac\u00ae, Veg Maharaja Mac\u00ae, Chicken McNuggets\u00ae, and Spicy Paneer Wrap\u00ae, to address various customer preferences while optimizing procurement and logistics.\n2. For procurement planning, consider the prevalence of menu items in each category (tag) and adjust the procurement accordingly, giving more importance to the most common tags.\n3. Pay special attention to allergen management, as a substantial portion of menu items contains milk, cereal containing gluten, and soya. This includes creating a contingency plan for finding alternative ingredients in case of supply chain disruptions.\n4. Regularly assess customer preferences and nutritional trends, adapting the menu offering and supply chain strategy accordingly to ensure that the menu stays on-demand and profitable."

Each disease has a unique set of symptoms that are more prevalent for them, such as stomach pain for GERD, joint pain for arthritis, and skin rash for psoriasis.\n5. The database also contains information on precautions for patients with specific diseases, with the most common precaution being to consult a doctor, followed by taking medication, and following up with the healthcare provider.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. When diagnosing patients, pay close attention to most frequent symptoms such as fatigue, vomiting, and high fever, as they are more likely to be associated with many diseases.\n2. For each disease in the database, consider focusing on the top 3-5 most frequently associated symptoms to improve diagnostic accuracy, especially when these symptoms appear together for the same patient.\n3. When improving treatment plans, refer to the precautions data to create personalized suggestions for each patient depending on their diagnosed disease.\n4. Always advise patients to consult a doctor as a primary precaution, and encourage regular follow-ups to ensure that their diagnosis and treatment are on track.\n5. When faced with a combination of symptoms that don't fit any known pattern in the database, consider investigating further through more tests or referrals to specialists. This will help prevent misdiagnosing patients and ensure that they receive appropriate treatment."

For each specific disease, there are distinct sets of symptoms and tests with varying percentages of occurrences.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider creating a decision tree or similar algorithm to help navigate through different symptoms and tests, allowing healthcare providers to make better-informed decisions.\n2. Expand the dataset to include more diseases, symptoms, and tests in order to improve the accuracy and generalizability of the analysis.\n3. Invest in research and development of more specialized diagnostic tests, particularly for diseases with similar symptoms.\n4.

The Multiple Disease Dataset provided includes information on 10 diseases along with their associated symptoms, tests, and medical consultants.\n2. Some of the most frequent symptoms in the dataset are Fever and Vomiting. These symptoms are common across different diseases, making it challenging to diagnose without additional tests or consultation.\n3. The most frequent test across the dataset is the Blood test, which is a common diagnostic tool for various diseases.\n4. General Physicians are the most frequently assigned consultants in the dataset, followed by Dermatologists.\n5. Comparing the relationships between diseases, we found that diseases share an average of 0.18 common symptoms and 0.27 common tests, indicating that the dataset is relatively diverse in terms of symptoms and tests.\n6. The frequency of diseases sharing the same consultant is 0.16, meaning that, in most cases, diseases require specialized consultants for their diagnosis and treatment.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Since Fever and Vomiting are common symptoms among many diseases, particular attention should be paid to verify the safety and effectiveness of treatments addressing these symptoms.\n2. Blood tests are frequently used for diagnosis, so it is essential to monitor the effectiveness of various blood tests and explore methods to enhance their accuracy and specificity.\n3. Consider collaborating with specialists from various fields, such as Dermatologists, Neurologists, Endocrinologists, Cardiologists, and Gastroenterologists, to have a more comprehensive analysis of the safety and effectiveness of treatments.\n4. Encourage pharmaceutical companies to diversify their research in treatments and diagnosis tools to address the wide range of symptoms and tests present in the dataset.\n5. As there is a high diversity in symptoms, tests, and consultants in the current dataset, it is suggested to expand the dataset further to have more accurate and comprehensive results when evaluating the safety and effectiveness of treatments."

Time of day patterns for the top-5 states with the highest average accidents show a similar trend, indicating that peak hours for accidents across these states are also during daylight hours.\n\n6. Month patterns for the top-5 states are also similar, with consistently high numbers of accidents across the months with some regional variations.\n\nThese insights can help guide the creation of new road safety policies and regulations, such as focusing on peak hours and months, enforcing stricter rules during daytime, and targeting efforts towards the high-risk states identified in the analysis. Furthermore, it might be beneficial to collect additional data on factors such as weather patterns, types of vehicles involved, and road conditions to better understand the causes of accidents and design more effective interventions.\n"

Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala are the top 5 states with the highest average number of accidents.\n3. Accidents are more likely to occur during the daylight hours (6 AM to 9 PM) with peak hours being 3 PM to 6 PM followed by 6 PM to 9 PM.\n4. Throughout the year, accident numbers remain relatively consistent, with the highest occurrence in May and December and the lowest in February.\n5. The time-of-day patterns for the top-5 states are similar, indicating peak hours for accident occurrences in these states are also during the daylight hours.\n6. Month-to-month accident patterns for the top-5 states are consistent with overall trends in India, with some regional variations.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Implement targeted road safety campaigns during peak hours (3 PM to 6 PM and 6 PM to 9 PM) to raise awareness and enforce stricter rules during these times.\n2. Focus on improving road safety in the top 5 high-risk states (Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala), such as increased patrolling and enforcing traffic laws.\n3. In the months of May and December, intensify road safety measures nationwide to reduce the higher number of accidents typically seen during these months.\n4. Collaborate with local authorities in the high-risk states to study regional variations in accident patterns and develop customized road safety initiatives.\n5. Expand the dataset to include factors like weather patterns, types of vehicles involved, and road conditions to gain better insights into accident causes and design more effective interventions.\n6. Develop partnerships with relevant stakeholders, such as automobile manufacturers, road transport organizations, and law enforcement agencies, to collaboratively improve road safety across the country."

Daytime accident rates are significantly higher in states like Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, and Sikkim compared to the mean accident rate.\n3. The nighttime accident rates are higher in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, and Haryana compared to the mean accident rate.\n4. There is a wide variation in the number of accidents depending on the state or union territory, with Tamil Nadu having the highest mean yearly accident rate and Lakshadweep having the lowest.\n5. A significant increasing trend in accident rates is observed in states like Sikkim, Goa, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Punjab, Daman & Diu, Assam, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, D & N Haveli, Madhya Pradesh, and Manipur.\n6. There were no states with a significant decreasing trend in accident rates throughout the observed period.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider adjusting insurance premiums for policyholders in states with higher daytime accident rates (such as Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, and Sikkim) to account for the heightened risk during those hours.\n2. Similarly, adjust premiums for policyholders in states with higher nighttime accident rates (such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, and Haryana) to reflect the increased accident risk during nighttime hours.\n3. Reevaluate and adjust policy pricing in states with a significant increasing trend in accident rates (like Sikkim, Goa, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Punjab, Daman & Diu, Assam, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, D & N Haveli, Madhya Pradesh, and Manipur) to ensure adequate coverage and risk management.\n4. Consider offering incentives or discounts for policyholders in states with lower accident rates to encourage safer driving behavior.\n5. Regularly monitor accident rate trends and update policy pricing accordingly to reflect the latest risk data and ensure fair pricing for policyholders."

The highest average number of accidents occurs during the time period 15-18 hrs (Day) and in the month of May.\n4. There is a high correlation between accidents occurring in nearby time periods and between accidents occurring in consecutive months.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Improve road safety in Tamil Nadu, focusing on the time period 15-18 hrs (Day) and the month of May when accidents peak.\n2. Install additional traffic signs, speed cameras, and improve road markings during daytime hours to guide drivers and enforce speed limits.\n3. Improve street lighting and add reflective road studs for night-time driving to increase visibility and guide drivers.\n4. Ensure proper drainage systems and enhance road friction during monsoon months to prevent accidents due to wet and slippery road conditions."

There are 7 products at catalog_level_number 1, 5 at catalog_level_number 8, and 3 at catalog_level_number 9.\n3. Products with the Green attribute have, on average, a higher price in dollars, but a lower price in euros and pounds compared to products without this attribute.\n4. There is a moderate to strong positive correlation between price_in_dollars, price_in_euros, and price_in_pounds, meaning that when the price increases in one currency, it tends to increase in the others as well.\n5. Capacity, length, height, and width dimensions of products have low to moderate correlations with their prices, which implies that the relationship between these dimensions and prices may not be very strong.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Since prices in different currencies are moderately correlated, consider focusing on synchronizing and updating prices in all currencies regularly to maintain consistency.\n2. Evaluate the reasons for the price discrepancies associated with the Green attribute in different currencies, and consider adjusting product pricing to match consumer expectations.\n3. In determining the factors that contribute to a product's price, consider investigating other factors beyond dimensions (capacity, length, height, and width), as the current analysis indicates a weak relationship between them.\n4. A re-evaluation of product inventory levels and storage requirements may be beneficial, given the varying product counts across different catalog levels.\n5. Further investigate additional attributes and their potential impact on purchase decisions for a deeper understanding of product-market fit.\n6. Finally, monitor the performance of the products in the coming months to better understand inventory turnover, in order to optimize supply chain operations."

The most popular attributes are Black and Yellow, each present in 2 products.\n2. The average price of products in the catalog is 622.77 USD, 492.86 EUR, and 407.23 GBP, with some variation across the three currencies.\n3. The most expensive product in dollars is \"Sprite Lemo\" with a price of 952.37 USD, and the least expensive product is \"Cola\" with a price of 200.78 USD. In euros and pounds, the most expensive product is \"Diet Mountain Dew\" with a price of 752.87 EUR and 678.01 GBP, while the least expensive product remains the same as in dollars, \"Cola.\"\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Since Black and Yellow attributes are the most popular, consider focusing on offering more products with these attributes or developing new products with these attributes to cater to customer preferences.\n2. Analyze customer feedback on the pricing of the products to determine if the prices are perceived as fair and competitive. If necessary, consider adjusting prices to reflect customer feedback and market trends.\n3. Investigate the reasons behind the price difference between the most and least expensive products, and consider if it's worth updating or diversifying the product offerings to cater to different customer segments (e.g., budget-friendly vs premium options).\n4. Collect more data on customer preferences, sales, and market trends to inform decisions on updating product offerings and understanding which attributes or product characteristics drive purchase decisions."

Consider reviewing your pricing strategy to ensure consistency across different currencies, as it may affect your customer's perception of the value of your products.\n2. Evaluate the performance of individual products within each category and sub-category. Identify the products that drive sales and profitability the most, and focus on promoting those products.\n3. Consider refining your catalog structure, making sure it caters to your target market. This may involve adding or removing categories or sub-categories, or reorganizing the catalog hierarchy.\n4. Take advantage of the attributes that are popular among customers (e.g., Yellow) and adjust product offerings or marketing strategies accordingly.\n5. Investigate the reasons behind unequal product distribution across categories and sub-categories. Assess if the company needs to invest resources to maintain variety in the catalog and adjust product offerings accordingly.\n6. Assess the overall catalog performance periodically to ensure that strategic business objectives are met and make adjustments to your catalog and marketing strategies if necessary."

There is a slight price difference between catalog levels, with level 8 products having the highest average price (656.66 dollars, 520.73 euros, 454.61 pounds) and level 9 products having the lowest average price (592.39 dollars, 477.94 euros, 425.02 pounds).\n3. There is a strong positive correlation between prices in different currencies: dollar-euro (0.93), dollar-pound (0.81), and euro-pound (0.90).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the factors affecting the price differences between catalog levels and consider adjusting the pricing strategy accordingly. For example, if level 8 products have better customer feedback, it might justify their higher price.\n2. Utilize the strong correlations between currency prices to streamline price adjustments during currency fluctuations. For example, if the exchange rate between dollars and euros changes significantly, it may lead to a corresponding change in the dollar-pound relationship. Adjusting the prices accordingly could maintain profitability.\n3. Review customer feedback for the high and low-priced products across all levels to understand the customers' perception of the products and gather insights on improving support operations. This could help in managing customer expectations and providing better-targeted customer service."

The most successful type in terms of winning awards is Program Music/Variety Show with a success rate of 67%.\n2. There is a strong negative correlation between the year of the festival and the number of won awards (-0.97), meaning that newer festivals have fewer victories.\n3. There is a strong positive correlation between the year of the festival and the number of nominations (0.97), meaning that newer festivals have more nominations.\n4. There is a strong negative correlation between the number of audiences and the number of won awards (-0.94), meaning that festivals with more audiences had fewer victories.\n5. There is a strong positive correlation between the number of audiences and the number of nominations (0.94), meaning that festivals with more audiences had more nominations.\n6. The only location in the database is the United States, where there have been 2 won awards and 4 nominations.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on analyzing Program Music/Variety Shows, since they have a higher success rate than other types of artworks.\n2. Take into account the strong correlations between year, number of audiences, and nominations/victories. More recent events may not have a history of award winners, but there might be an increasing trend in nominations because of their popularity and audience size.\n3. Look for differences in the award nomination and victory behaviors among the festivals. Although the available data is limited to the United States, try to explore other geographies and take country-specific factors into account if the data becomes available.\n4. Investigate further into festival-related factors, such as the jury composition, submission process, or media coverage, to better understand the patterns of nominations and victories.\n5. Keep in mind that the current dataset is small and may not fully represent the entirety of the entertainment awards landscape. This analysis should be updated and expanded with more data to provide a more comprehensive view."

There are four types of artworks in the database, with Program Music/Variety Show being the most common type (3 artworks), followed by Presenter Music/Variety Show, Program Talent Show, and Presenter Talent Show, each having 1 artwork.\n2. There are three festivals in the database that have nominated and awarded artworks: Panasonic Awards, Flower Awards, and LA Awards.\n3. In the Program Music/Variety Show category, there is a 67% win rate, while other categories haven't won any awards.\n4. All festival events nominated and awarded artworks in different years: Panasonic Awards in 2006, Flower Awards in 2007, and LA Awards in 2010.\n5. On average, each festival nominated and awarded an equal number of artworks (2), with Panasonic Awards and Flower Awards having a 50% win rate while LA awards haven't presented any awards.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As a festival judge, prioritize evaluating artworks from the Program Music/Variety Show category, as they have a higher win rate compared to other categories based on the data available.\n2. Consider evaluating the artworks from Panasonic Awards and Flower Awards more closely since they have a higher win rate in recent years (50%).\n3. Be cautious in making conclusions based on the small dataset available, as it may not fully represent the universe of artworks and their chances of winning.\n4. Reach out to other festival organizers or experienced judges to gather more qualitative information on the submitted artworks to complement the quantitative data analysis.\n5. Consider exploring additional factors such as audience feedback or artwork creator history in selecting winners, as the existing dataset may not provide complete insights."

The dataset consists of 15 unique lots, spread across multiple investors.\n3. Some investors have conducted both buying and selling transactions, while others have only performed one type of transaction or no transaction at all.\n4. The total amount invested and total shares purchased by investor 19 is significantly higher than other investors.\n5. The trading activity varies across different years with no apparent pattern to buying and selling transactions.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the reason for the large investment and share purchase by investor 19, as this could be indicative of market confidence or potential insider information.\n2. Explore relationships between lots' details and investors' trading behavior to identify any trends or key factors driving investment decisions.\n3. Continue to monitor the market trends and investors\u2019 activities to ensure optimal allocation of resources across different lots.\n4. Analyze trading activity in more recent years (not covered by the current dataset) to make more informed decisions based on the latest market trends.\n5. Keep tracking the investors who haven't made any transactions to identify the potential driving factors for their decision and how their perspectives may affect the market as a whole."

The risk associated with each investor's investment, as measured by the standard deviation of transaction amounts, indicates variability in investor 19's transactions.

Focus on investor 6 as they have the highest share value ratio, which could be an opportunity for the fund to grow.\n2. Monitor investor 19's investments closely, as they have higher variability in their transaction amounts, indicating higher risk.\n3. Consider engaging with investors 7 and 20 to improve their investment portfolios, as their share value ratios are very low, implying minimal financial contribution to the fund's performance.\n4. Investigate the reasons for the lack of variability in transaction amounts for investors 6, 7, and 20, and consider strategies to manage potential risks, including diversification.\n5. Regularly review the performance and risk indicators for each investor to minimize the overall risk while ensuring the growth of the portfolio."

The average height of these mountains is 4061.26 meters.\n2. There are 11 different camera lenses in the database with focal lengths ranging from 14mm to 150mm. The average focal length is 42.23mm.\n3. The maximum aperture of the camera lenses ranges from 1.2 to 8, with an average value of 2.62.\n4. 8 photos in the database are in RGB color and 2 photos are in black and white.\n5. There is a moderate positive correlation (0.44) between the prominence of the mountains and the focal length of the camera lenses used to take the photos, which suggests that more prominent mountains are captured with longer focal lengths.\n6. There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.56) between the prominence of the mountains and the maximum aperture of the camera lenses used to take the photos, which suggests that more prominent mountains are captured with smaller apertures (less light is allowed into the lens).\n7. In the photos that we have, the average height of the mountains is 4073.8 meters, and the average prominence is 1920 meters.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Based on the correlation between prominence and focal length, consider choosing photos of more prominent mountains that were taken with larger focal lengths (greater than the average of 42.23mm) to emphasize the scale and drama of the landscape.\n2. Since there is a correlation between prominence and maximum aperture, consider selecting photos taken with smaller apertures (resulting in a larger depth of field) to ensure that both the mountain and its surroundings are in sharp focus.\n3. To show diversity, include some photos taken with the less commonly used black and white color format, as these photos may evoke a different mood compared to the RGB photos.\n4. Finally, as a magazine editor, also consider factors like composition, lighting, and other artistic elements of the photos when making your selection, as these factors can significantly affect the visual impact and appeal of the photos to your readers."

The dataset contains mountains from 5 different countries, with 13 mountains in Ethiopia, 6 in Morocco, 2 in Kenya, 1 in Cameroon, and 1 shared between Rwanda and Uganda.\n4. The average camera lens focal length used for the photos is 42.23 mm, with a minimum focal length of 14 mm and a maximum focal length of 150 mm.\n5. The average maximum aperture of the camera lenses is 2.62, with a minimum aperture of 1.20 and a maximum aperture of 8.0.\n6. There is a moderate negative correlation between mountain prominence and the maximum aperture of the camera lens used, suggesting that photos with higher prominence mountains tend to use lenses with smaller maximum apertures.\n7. There is a weak positive correlation between mountain height and prominence, indicating that the taller mountains tend to have higher prominences in the dataset.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Select photos that represent a diverse range of mountain heights and prominences to showcase the variety of mountains in the database.\n2. Choose photos from multiple countries, prioritizing Ethiopia, Morocco, and Kenya to reflect the distribution of mountains in the database.\n3. Include a mix of photos taken with different camera lens focal lengths to demonstrate the varying perspectives and photographic capabilities.\n4. Prioritize photos with smaller maximum apertures for high-prominence mountains, as the existing data shows a moderate correlation between these features.\n5. Ensure that the advertising and promotion materials also highlight the geographic diversity, mountain heights, and prominences to attract tourists with varying interests in mountain exploration."

The range of camera lens focal lengths used for the photos is between 14mm and 150mm.\n3. The majority of photos (8 out of 10) are in RGB color scheme, while 2 are in Black/White.\n4. Black/White photos tend to feature mountains with greater height (4165 meters) and prominence (2920 meters) compared to RGB photos (mean height of 4051 meters, mean prominence of 1670 meters).\n5. The camera lens brands used in the dataset are Sigma, Olympus, Panasonic, and Schneider Kreuznach, with Sigma being the most used (4 out of 10 photos).\n6. The correlation between mountain height and Black/White color scheme is negative (-0.44), and the correlation between prominence and Black/White color scheme is also negative (-0.34). This indicates a slightly more popular preference for monochrome photos of taller and more prominent mountains.\n7. No significant correlation was found between mountain height and focal length, while a moderate positive correlation was found between mountain prominence and focal length (0.44).\n8. A negative correlation was found between both mountain height and prominence and maximum aperture, meaning that photos of taller and more prominent mountains tend to have smaller apertures (greater depth of field).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize selecting photos with a Black/White color scheme for taller and more prominent mountains, as they are slightly more popular among the dataset.\n2. Consider using camera lenses with a focal length that moderately corresponds with mountain prominence to achieve better results in capturing the mountain's features.\n3. Choose lenses with smaller apertures (greater depth of field) for photos of taller and more prominent mountains, as the negative correlation shows that these apertures are more commonly used for such mountains.\n4. Since Sigma is the most popular camera lens brand in the dataset, including more photos taken with Sigma lenses may be attractive to potential customers.\n5. Finally, it would be beneficial to expand the dataset to get more comprehensive findings and improve the accuracy of suggestions, as the current dataset is limited to only 10 photos."

No hotel visit data is available in the data provided, so it is not possible to determine the most popular accommodations.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Upgrade and invest more resources in popular attractions such as \"US museum,\" \"exploration trial,\" and \"jungle cruise\" to keep visitors engaged and attract more guests.\n2. Conduct more in-depth studies on the least visited attractions to understand the reasons behind their lower visit counts and determine whether they can be improved, or if they need to be replaced.\n3. Collect more data on hotel visits or work with hotels within the park to gather data on guests and their preferences to provide insights for improvements and informed decisions on accommodations."

Cutlery products have the highest demand, with a total sum revenue of 2,340.11 and 10 bookings, followed by Dinner Plates products with 414.15 revenue and 2 bookings.\n2. Product 1, a Cutlery product, has the highest revenue among all products and has been booked 4 times.\n3. Product 5, another Cutlery product, has the second-highest average revenue per booking, although it has been booked only 3 times.\n4. Good customers returned late or damaged items relatively less often, with late return percentages ranging from 33.33-50% and damaged item percentages of 50-100%.\n5. Bad customers were not a significant portion of customer demand but were responsible for 100% late returns and damaged items for their bookings.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Invest in more Cutlery products, as they have shown to be in the highest demand.\n2. Monitor customer behavior and consider implementing incentives for good customer behavior, such as discounts or loyalty programs that reward customers for timely returns and careful handling of rental items.\n3. Consider revising penalties for late returns and damaged items to deter bad customer behavior, such as increasing late fees or charging additional costs for repairing damages.\n4. Periodically review customer behavior and product demand to adjust inventory and business strategies accordingly.\n5. Conduct customer surveys or analyze trends in the market to identify potential equipment or items that have not been considered for rental, helping diversify your rental inventory to cater to a broader spectrum of customer needs."

Investigate inconsistencies between bookings and payment records, as some customers have bookings without corresponding payment entries, or vice versa. This can help ensure the database accurately reflects transactions.\n2. Monitor booking activities and identify patterns or trends among good and bad customers in terms of booking and payment behaviors. This information can be used to improve customer retention and tailor marketing efforts.\n3. Analyze product usage and popularity based on the booking/application data to optimize the product offering and target market segment.

Cargo ships are more suited for maritime trading with higher tonnage capacity as compared to Battle ships.\n3. The ships have an average age between 90 and 106 years, with newer ships launched in the early 1930s.\n4. Speeds of ships vary, with some ships capable of speeds up to 25 knots.\n5. Ships' fates include being decommissioned, lost (burned), or retired.\n6. Each ship has completed one mission in its history, with varying results.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on Cargo ships as they have higher tonnage capacity, which is better suited for maritime trading.\n2. Consider ships with higher speeds, as they can complete missions more quickly.\n3. Select ships with more recent launched years, as newer ships are likely to be more reliable and have better technology.\n4. Pay attention to ships' fates when selecting ships. Ships that have been decommissioned or retired may have better safety records than those that were lost due to accidents. \n\nNote: The data available has limited information to make a definitive decision. Additional factors like maintenance records, operating costs, and crew expertise should also be considered before making a final decision."

Consider using battle ships more frequently for missions as they have a higher success rate than cargo ships.\n2. Investigate the factors that contributed to the high success rate of United Kingdom ships to improve the success rate of other nationalities.\n3. Analyze other factors that may contribute to mission success, such as crew training, ship maintenance schedules, and mission objectives.\n4. Conduct more missions in different locations to gather more data and identify trends or factors influencing the success rate.\n5. Despite the lack of correlation between mission success and speed or tonnage, do not entirely dismiss these factors, as other non-linear relationships may influence mission outcomes.

The overall tonnage in our dataset is higher for Cargo ships (16,165) than for Battle ships (14,535).\n5. United Kingdom ships (4) dominate the dataset in terms of the number of missions, followed by United States ships (3).\n6. United States ships outperform United Kingdom ships with an average speed of 23.67 knots compared to 21.75 knots.\n7. United Kingdom ships have a higher overall tonnage with 18,703 compared to the 11,997 for United States ships.\n8. The age group analysis did not yield any relevant findings due to an issue with the age binning which resulted in empty results.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Based on the higher average speed, focusing on manufacturing Cargo ships could be a better option.\n2. However, consider market demand and other factors, such as profitability, before making a final decision on which ship type to focus on.\n3. Collaborate with United States shipbuilders for their expertise as their ships tend to have higher average speeds.\n4. Look into data errors or other issues with the ship age information, and consider re-running the age group analysis to better understand how age may impact ship performance.\n5. Obtain a larger dataset to better understand the overall ship market trends and make a more informed decision, as the current dataset is quite small and might not accurately represent broader trends."

The average speed of the ships is 22.57 knots, ranging from 16 to 25 knots.\n5. The tonnage of the ships varies from 3035 to 7781, with an average of 4385.71.\n6. In terms of mission fates, 57.14% were decommissioned, 28.57% were lost, and 14.29% retired.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider charging higher insurance premiums for ships with higher speed, as these ships might be more likely to encounter accidents or require more expensive maintenance.\n2. Differentiate insurance premiums based on ship type, as cargo ships and battle ships may have different risk profiles.\n3. Offer different premium rates for ships from different countries, as there might be differences in safety regulations, maintenance, and operation.\n4. The age of the ship could also be a factor to consider, as older ships might be more prone to accidents or require more maintenance.\n5. Given the small sample size of our database, consider obtaining more data on ship missions for a more accurate assessment of insurance premiums and more informed decision-making."

The top customers (Jeramie, Beulah, George, and Hadley) represent 80% of the total orders.\n3. The average shipping time for these top customers varies, with some negative values indicating potential errors in the data.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on personalizing promotions and advertising for these top customers, as they make up the majority of the orders.\n2. Investigate the negative average shipping times for some customers and verify the accuracy of the data in these cases. Accurate data will be critical for setting proper expectations and designing promotional strategies.\n3. Analyze the products frequently purchased by the top customers and create tailored advertising campaigns targeting their interests.\n4. Consider implementing a customer loyalty program for these high-value customers to further incentivize repeat purchases and reward them for their engagement with your business."

The proportion of order statuses (On Road, Packing, Shipped) varies across different years, indicating potential changes or inconsistencies in the order handling process.\n3. The top 5 most ordered products are product IDs 15, 3, 4, 11, and 14.\n4. Among the top 5 products, there are differences in the proportion of order item statuses (Finish, Payed, Cancel), indicating different customer behavior for different products.\n5. The average time between order placement and shipment is -442.73 days, which indicates a problem in the data, as shipment dates should not be earlier than order placement dates.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate why there are inconsistencies in the order handling process over different years, and standardize the process to avoid fluctuations in order statuses.\n2. Focus inventory management efforts on the most ordered products and closely monitor their demand and supply.\n3. Analyze the reasons behind different order item statuses for the top 5 products, gather customer feedback, and consider targeted promotions or pricing strategies to reduce cancellation rates and improve product satisfaction.\n4. Verify the data accuracy, particularly with regards to order placement and shipment dates, as the current results are not reliable for measuring shipping efficiency.\n5. Once the data is verified and corrected, re-analyze shipping time and, if needed, optimize the shipping process to reduce delivery time and improve customer satisfaction."

The processing time (time between order placement and shipment) varies a lot depending on the order status: average processing time is 684 days for \"On Road\" orders, -81 days for \"Packing\" orders (which means the shipment typically happened before the order's placement, which is an anomaly), and -278 days for \"Shipped\" orders (also an anomaly).\n2. The average invoicing time (time between order placement and invoice) is mostly positive, ranging from 2638 days for \"On Road\" orders, 3824 days for \"Packing\" orders, and 4064 days for \"Shipped\" orders.\n3. The shipping time (time between invoice and shipment) is negative for most order statuses, which indicates the shipments are typically made before the invoice is created, a possible inconsistency in the data.\n4. The shipping methods used vary per order status and customers. For \"On Road\" orders, Courier Service C is the most common method, while \"Packing\" orders use mostly Courier Service B and C. Most \"Shipped\" orders have an unknown method.\n5. Shipping methods for different customers vary, with no clear pattern across all customers.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the cause of negative processing times and shipping times to understand the inconsistencies and improve the data quality for further analysis.\n2. As a logistics manager, discuss the results with the customer support team to identify any unique requirements or preferences of specific customers that could explain the differences in shipping methods and duration.\n3. Consider evaluating the performance of each shipping method (Courier Service A, B, and C) to identify the most cost-effective and fastest options.\n4. Depending on the desired improvement in delivery speeds, consider partnering with additional courier services or prioritize faster shipping methods for specific order statuses or customers.\n5. Continuously monitor shipping performance data to detect any significant changes in shipping methods or durations and adjust your logistics strategy accordingly."

Product 14 is the most popular product with the highest number of orders.\n2. Products 3, 4, 7, and 15 also have a significant number of orders, contributing to the warehouse's overall demand.\n3. Shipping improvement is recommended for all top 5 products, as their Shipping_ratio is below the threshold of 0.75.\n4. Reordering frequency varies from frequent for products 3 and 15, regular for product 14, and less frequent for products 4 and 7.\n5. Avg_days_to_ship differs significantly for each product, meaning that the shipping time for each product varies.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Stock products 14 and 3 with a higher quantity as they have the highest demand.\n2. Maintain a moderate stock level for products 4, 7, and 15 to avoid overstocking and missing potential sales opportunities.\n3. Implement improvements in the shipping process as all products have low shipping ratios. This can increase customer satisfaction and streamline warehouse operations.\n4. Adjust reorder frequency for each product with different approaches - frequent reorders for products 3 and 15, regular reorders for product 14, and less frequent reorders for products 4 and 7.\n5. Monitor the warehouse's stock levels and shipping times for each product to adapt to any changes in customer demand and market trends."

Schedule the gymnasts according to their total point rankings, starting with the highest-ranked gymnast.\n2. Optionally, you can further optimize the order of performance within each event by following the rank of each gymnast in the specific event, giving priority to higher-ranked gymnasts.\n3. Make sure to have an appropriate balance between gymnasts from different hometowns throughout the schedule to keep the audience engaged.\n4. Remember that correlations between age, height, and performance are weak; therefore, they should not be a crucial factor in deciding the order of performance and scheduling. Focus more on the performance ranking in each event and total points."

The top 10 players based on their recent rankings are Shuai Zhang, Jil Belen Teichmann, Miharu Imanishi, Sarah Rebecca Sekulic, Laura Schaeder, Chi Chi Scholl, Ran Tian, Linnea Malmqvist, Kennedy Shaffer, and Kristina Milenkovic.\n2. Among the top 10 most recently ranked players, Shuai Zhang has the highest ranking points (1685) and is ranked 28th, while Kristina Milenkovic has the lowest ranking points (9) and is ranked 995th.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As a sports agent, you should consider focusing on representing players with the highest recent rankings, like Shuai Zhang, to secure more sponsorship deals and better opportunities. \n2. You may also want to keep an eye on players with lower rankings, like Kennedy Shaffer and Kristina Milenkovic, who might have great potential for improvement, as representing and nurturing them could be beneficial in the long run.\n3. Keep monitoring the most recent rankings and ranking points on a regular basis, as the performance of players may change over time, and new top-ranked players may emerge."

As most players prefer hard surfaces, consider sponsoring and advertising more prominently at tournaments with hard court surfaces to capture a larger audience.\n3.

Left-handed players have a higher win-loss ratio (0.57) compared to right-handed players (0.50).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider giving higher seeding priority to younger players, as they tend to have higher rankings.\n2. Incorporate the win-loss ratio of the players into the seeding process, giving higher seeds to players with better performance in recent matches.\n3. Don't rely solely on the ranking points when determining seeding; consider factors like win-loss ratio, age, or even playing hand, as left-handed players show a higher win-loss ratio, which could provide interesting match-ups.\n4. For determining the draw size, consider the number of players with high win-loss ratios or rankings above a certain threshold that will ensure a competitive and exciting tournament."

The city with the highest number of flights is Chicago (ORD) in the United States, followed by Paris (CDG) in France and Beijing (PEK) in China.\n3. The cheapest airline, on average, is East African Safari Air, and the most expensive airline, on average, is Japan Asia Airways.\n4. The top 5 busiest airports have the following most common destinations: Chicago (destinations not identified), Paris (Chicago, Marseille, Palermo), Beijing (Kunming, Harbin, Changcha), Dallas-Fort Worth (undetermined), and Frankfurt (New York, Thessaloniki, Istanbul).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As a travel agent, focus on offering flight bookings with popular airlines like Ryanair, American Airlines, and China Southern Airlines to provide a wide range of options for clients.\n2. Pay attention to the busiest airports (Chicago, Paris, Beijing, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Frankfurt) as they are likely to have the most demand for flights and potentially better deals for clients.\n3. When comparing prices, consider booking flights with cheaper airlines such as East African Safari Air for budget-conscious clients, while offering more premium options like Japan Asia Airways for clients with higher budgets.\n4. For the top 5 busiest airports, familiarize yourself with their most common destinations to provide accurate information to clients and tailor your offerings accordingly."

Implement stricter regulations or allocate more resources to manage air traffic at the busiest airports, focusing particularly on Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n2. Monitor airlines with high flight counts, such as Ryanair, to ensure they are adhering to regulations and not further contributing to overcrowding at airports.\n3. Continue monitoring the busiest routes, such as HRE to LUN, and consider optimizing flight timings, distribution, and alternative routes to reduce congestion.\n4. Encourage airlines to explore opportunities for route expansion to distribute the traffic load across more airports and routes.\n5. Coordinate with airlines to optimally schedule flights throughout the day to avoid uneven traffic distributions and overcrowding at peak times."

Investigate possible reasons behind the decline in ratings and viewership over time, such as the quality of content, the time slots they were aired, or any external factors that could have affected the viewership.\n4. Study the content types that had higher ratings and share to find common factors, which may help to understand what could make other content in the portfolio more engaging for the audience.\n5.

These singers are Christy Walton, Gina Rinehart, Iris Fontbona, Liliane Bettencourt, and Susanne Klatten.\n2. If you wish to consider other factors, such as net worth or citizenship, you can further filter the suggested singers based on those variables. For instance, you might want to prioritize booking singers with higher net worth or from certain countries.\n3.

If possible, expand the database to include a larger number of singers and their chart performances for a more comprehensive analysis."

On the other hand, there is a moderate positive correlation between age and success metrics, which suggests that older singers tend to achieve more success in the music industry.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Since the data provided is limited (only 8 entries) and correlation values are only moderate, further investigation with a larger dataset should be conducted to draw more definitive conclusions.\n2. When studying the correlation between birth year or age and success in the music industry, consider additional factors such as the singer's genre of music, the music technology available during their careers, and the size of their fanbase, as these factors might also affect their success.\n3. Consider engaging with other music historians or conducting qualitative research to gather more insights into the factors that impact success in the music industry during different time periods and among different age groups of singers.\n4. Based on the moderate positive correlation between age and success, an analysis of older singers in the industry may reveal interesting trends or practices that younger singers can learn from.\n5. While making a decision, remember that correlation does not imply causation; success in the music industry is likely influenced by many factors other than birth year or age. Conducting a more in-depth analysis is crucial for a better understanding of the music industry's dynamics."

The total sales achieved for this singer after filtering are 1,646,407. The average net worth for these singers is 30 million.\n3. Liliane Bettencourt has two songs in the database that meet the criteria - \"Do They Know It's Christmas\" with 1,094,000 sales, and \"F**k It (I Don't Want You Back)\" with 552,407 sales.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Based on the analysis, you should consider representing Liliane Bettencourt, as she is the only singer that meets both the net worth and sales criteria in the current dataset.\n2. Analyzing a larger dataset with more singers could potentially reveal other artists who meet or exceed these thresholds, providing a wider range of options for representation."

Allocate more resources to Shanghai, as it has the highest population and GDP among all cities, and also has a lower annual mean temperature.\n2. Monitor the development of Suzhou (Jiangsu), as it has the second-highest GDP and is one of the cities with the highest annual mean temperature.

Nanjing (Jiangsu) has the highest average temperature among the cities, making it potentially more attractive for tourists seeking a pleasant climate.\n2. Nanjing (Jiangsu) has also hosted the most matches, indicating its popularity as a destination for sports and leisure activities.\n3. Wuxi (Jiangsu) has the highest GDP per capita, suggesting a higher standard of living, which can be appealing to tourists.\n4. When considering temperature, matches hosted, and GDP per capita together, Nanjing (Jiangsu) has the highest combined score, indicating it might be the most popular destination for tourism and leisure activities.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize visiting Nanjing (Jiangsu) as it ranks high in terms of temperature, matches hosted, and GDP per capita, making it potentially the most popular destination for tourism and leisure activities.\n2. Consider visiting Wuxi (Jiangsu) as well, mainly due to its high GDP per capita, which might indicate a higher standard of living and quality of tourist facilities.\n3. If you're interested in exploring cities with pleasant climates, you might consider Jiaxing (Zhejiang), as it has the second highest average temperature.\n4. Keep in mind that some cities have insufficient data on matches hosted, such as Hangzhou (Zhejiang), Suzhou (Jiangsu), and Jinhua (Zhejiang). You may want to conduct further research on these cities to get a clearer understanding of their tourism potential."

Among the analyzed cities, Shanghai has the highest regional population and GDP, making it the most attractive city for investment based on the score calculated.\n2. Suzhou (Jiangsu), Hangzhou (Zhejiang), Nanjing (Jiangsu), and Ningbo (Zhejiang) are the next top cities with significant regional population and GDP levels, following Shanghai.\n3. There is a strong positive correlation (0.97) between population and GDP per capita, which indicates that cities with higher populations tend to have higher GDP per capita.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize investment in Shanghai, as it presents the highest potential according to the analyzed data regarding population and GDP.\n2. Consider expanding investment opportunities to Suzhou (Jiangsu), Hangzhou (Zhejiang), Nanjing (Jiangsu), and Ningbo (Zhejiang) to diversify the investment portfolio and take advantage of their growing regional population and GDP levels.\n3. Assess factors beyond population and GDP per capita, such as infrastructure, local real estate market conditions, and government policies, to make sure a well-rounded decision is made."

On average, customers spend the most money on Electronics ($91.18), followed by DVDs ($74.34), Food ($35.08), and Books ($13.25).\n3. The top 5 products by total sales are Hard Drive, Beer Menus, Harry Potter 3, Arts, and Harry Potter 2.\n4. The bottom 5 products by total sales are TV, Chocolate, Harry Potter 4, Fans, and Learning English.\n5. The products purchased by the most customers are Harry Potter 3, Hard Drive, and Arts. All other products were purchased by only one customer.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on promoting and stocking products in the Electronics and DVDs categories, as they have higher average customer spending.\n2. Consider offering special deals or bundle packages for the top-selling products (Hard Drive, Beer Menus, Harry Potter 3, Arts, and Harry Potter 2) to attract more customers and boost sales.\n3. Evaluate the market potential for the bottom-selling products (TV, Chocolate, Harry Potter 4, Fans, and Learning English) and decide whether to discontinue or revamp these products.\n4. Given that some products were purchased by only one customer, investigate if there are any specific customer preferences or niche markets that can be further explored to boost sales and diversify the product offerings.\n5. Conduct surveys to gather more customer feedback on product preferences, in order to better tailor products and promotions to meet customer needs."

Other top-selling products include \"Harry Potter 3,\" \"Arts,\" \"Harry Potter 2,\" \"Learning English,\" and \"Harry Potter 4\".\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As a marketing manager, you should focus on promoting the \"Dvd products\" category, as it currently generates the highest revenue.\n2. Consider investing in more advertising or promotion around top-selling products, such as \"Hard Drive\" and \"Beer Menus,\" to continue driving their sales.\n3. Encourage customers to purchase from the \"Electrical devices\" category, as it is the second most profitable category.\n4. Evaluate the products in the \"Books\" category, which has the lowest revenue, to identify possible improvements or opportunities for cross-promotion with other more profitable categories.\n5. Continually analyze the sales data to monitor the impact of your marketing efforts on product and category revenue, and adjust your strategies accordingly to maximize profitability."

Consider focusing more on the Electronics category, as it has been generating positive profits. Invest in expanding the Electronics product offerings and promoting them more aggressively.\n2. Investigate the reasons for the negative profits in the Books, DVDs, and Food categories. Identify possible ways to reduce expenses or increase revenue in those categories.\n3. Analyze the sales data further to identify specific products or product subcategories within the profitable and unprofitable categories. This could help in making more targeted decisions for improving profitability.\n4. Examine other factors such as seasonal trends, customer preferences, and market competition to understand the reasons behind the current revenue and expense trends better.

We analyzed sales data and found that the most popular product category is Dvd products with 7 sales, followed by Books and Electrical devices with 3 sales each, and Food with 2 sales.\n2. The category with the highest total sales value was Books with $229.52, followed by Dvd products with $457.00, Electrical devices with $198.33, and Food with $154.62.\n3. The average sale value for Books is $76.51, for Dvd products is $65.29, for Electrical devices is $66.11, and for Food is $77.31.\n4. When analyzing customer financial transactions, we found that customers 8, 9, 12, and 13 have made payments, and customers 8, 12, 13, and 15 have received refunds. Customers 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 have made orders.\n5. The total revenue, total refunds, and total payments for each customer show that customers 8 and 12 have negative net payments, whereas customer 13 has a positive net payment.\n6. The number of orders, average order value, and total revenue from orders for each customer indicate that customer 10 has the highest total revenue from orders, followed by customers 5, 6, 12, 11, and 1.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. To reconcile financial transactions and records, compare the total revenue from orders for each customer with their total financial transactions revenue. This will help identify any discrepancies in the data.\n2. Investigate the reasons for customers having negative net payments (customers 8 and 12) and verify if this matches the transactions in your accounting records.\n3. Perform a thorough examination of customer transactions, refunds, and order data to ensure data integrity and consistency across the system.\n4. In the future, consider implementing additional data checks and input validation to reduce the chances of data discrepancies and improve the reliability of your financial records."

The most popular product in successful orders is 'gift', followed by 'dvds'. Other product categories are not represented in successful orders.\n3. Visa is the most popular payment method among customers, followed by Discover and MasterCard. Visa and Discover are the preferred payment methods among successful orders.\n4. Most orders are in 'Ready' status (46.67%), followed by 'On Road' (26.67%) and 'Delivered' (26.67%).\n5. The average delivery time for successful orders is slightly negative (-1 days +20:40:36.833333334), which might be an issue with the data recording in the database.\n6. Tennessee has the highest number of delivery addresses, followed by Michigan, Colorado, and California. Other states have significantly lower numbers of delivery addresses.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the reasons for the high cancellation rate and develop strategies to reduce it, such as streamlining the order process or offering incentives for completing purchases.\n2. Focus on promoting more successful product categories like 'gift' and 'dvds' to increase sales, and consider expanding offerings in these categories.\n3. Offer multiple payment options to cater to customer preferences, including mobile payments and other digital wallets to adapt to different payment trends.\n4. Monitor the delivery status and address delivery bottlenecks to improve customer satisfaction, and ensure that the delivery system can handle peak sales periods.\n5. Review the data entry process for recording order and delivery dates. Fix any discrepancies found, and ensure the correct capturing of delivery times in the future.\n6. Tailor marketing and promotion efforts to target states with a higher concentration of delivery addresses, such as Tennessee, Michigan, Colorado, and California. Exploit regional trends in these areas to boost sales and attract new customers."

Since the dataset has a limited number of successful orders, it's not definitive to identify the most popular product across delivery routes. Collect more data and rerun the analysis to obtain more accurate trends.\n2. As of now, the Gift product seems more popular due to higher total sales; however, this might change when more data is available.\n3. Monitor the performance of different products at various locations over time to determine the best-selling items and trends.\n4. Implement targeted marketing campaigns for the products and delivery locations that perform well, considering the preliminary findings.\n5. Consider proposing discounts, flash sales, or bundle deals to expand and enhance customer interest in various products across the delivery routes, and measure the response to these offers."

There might be a discrepancy in the billing system.\n2. Payment success rate: 40% of the orders are marked as \"Success,\" which indicates that payment compliance is lower than ideal.\n3. Delivery success rate: Only 20% of the orders have been delivered successfully, while the remaining 80% are still \"Ready\" or yet to be delivered.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate the billing system to ensure proper calculation of billed amounts, taking into account product prices and payment processing fees.\n2. Assess the reasons for a low payment success rate and work on improving payment compliances for better customer experience and business revenue. Some actions may include better payment gateway integration, better support for payment disputes, and clearer pricing information.\n3. Evaluate the delivery process to identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies and improve the delivery success rate. Consider better route planning, more reliable delivery partners, and improving communication between drivers and customers."

Out of 15 orders, 66.67% were canceled, and only 33.33% were successful.\n3. The time taken for successful deliveries has a mean of -1 day (meaning some deliveries were completed before the order date), with a minimum of -15 days and a maximum of 12 days. This indicates a potential issue with data quality for delivery dates.\n4. Routes 14, 2, and 13 are the most frequently used with 26.67% utilization each, while route 11 is less frequently used with 20% utilization.\n5. Trucks 11, 10, and 6 are used in 20% of the deliveries each, while trucks 2, 4, 9, 1, and 5 are used less frequently (ranging from 6.67% to 13.33%).\n6. Employees' delivery performance shows Kacie with the highest number of total deliveries (3), while other employees delivered 1 or 2 deliveries.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize stocking more \"books\" as they are the most popular product, while also maintaining adequate stock levels for \"dvds\" and \"gift\" items.\n2. Investigate the reasons behind the high number of canceled orders to identify potential issues in the ordering and delivery process, and take necessary action to improve order success rates.\n3. Review the delivery date data and resolve potential data quality issues, then recalculate the time taken for successful deliveries for a more accurate analysis.\n4.

The average number of hours required for a project is 1441.64, but the workload varies significantly, with a standard deviation of 2902.38 hours.\n3. The project with the highest number of hours is \"A Magnetic Primer Designer\" in the Bte category, requiring 9684 hours, whereas the project with the lowest number of hours is \"Aerodynamics of Air Hockey\" in the AeH category, requiring only 89 hours.\n4. The most common word in project names is \"a\", representing 6 out of 14 projects. Besides that, \"aerodynamics\" is a popular research theme, appearing in the names of 5 projects.\n5. The AeH category has the most projects (6) and the lowest average hours per project (262.83), whereas the Bte category has the highest average hours per project (3442.00), despite having only 3 projects.\n6. The Ast category has the second-highest average hours per project (2319.00) with 3 projects, and the Che category has the third-highest average hours per project (661.50) with 2 projects.\n\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider prioritizing projects with lower time requirements, like those from the AeH category, to maximize the number of funded projects within a fixed time period.\n2. Evaluate the potential impact and novelty of projects in the Bte and Ast categories, as they seem to be more time-consuming but may provide significant breakthroughs or advancements in their respective fields.\n3. Pay special attention to projects related to \"aerodynamics\" as they seem to be popular research areas and may have a wider interest among the scientific community.\n4. Keep in mind that the number of hours is just one aspect of a project's merits, so it's crucial to evaluate other factors such as scientific importance, feasibility, resource requirements, and potential applications of the research when making a decision.\n5.

The average project duration is 1441.64 hours, with a median of 310 hours, indicating a skewed distribution.\n4. Most projects (7 out of 14) have duration between 100 and 500 hours.\n5. Two projects, \"A Magnetic Primer Designer\" and \"Build Your Own Telescope,\" contribute more than 80% of total project hours.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider focusing on projects with duration between 100 and 500 hours, as they represent the majority of projects and have manageable durations.\n2. Take into account the percentage share of each project in the total project hours, favoring investments in projects with higher percentages, if larger projects are more desirable for your business.\n3. Investigate the feasibility and potential returns of the two highest-hour projects, \"A Magnetic Primer Designer\" and \"Build Your Own Telescope,\" as they represent a significant portion of the total hours.\n4. For smaller projects (less than 100 hours), carefully assess their potential impact and returns, considering they contribute a relatively small portion of the total project hours."

The Ast and Bte categories have higher average hours spent on projects (2,319 and 3,442 hours, respectively) compared to the AeH and Che categories (262.83 and 661.50 hours, respectively).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider promoting projects from the AeH and Che categories to students and faculty, as these projects tend to have lower average hours, making them more accessible for participants with less available time.\n2. If looking for challenging or advanced projects, recommend projects from the Ast and Bte categories, which have higher average hours and may require more dedication and effort.\n3. Encourage participants to choose projects based on their interest, but also keep in mind the time commitment, using the top 5 highest and lowest hours projects as examples of extremes in time commitment.\n4. Regularly update and extend the database with new projects and related information to provide a more comprehensive analysis and a wider range of project choices for students and faculty.\n5. Consider collecting additional information, such as project difficulties, required skills, and available resources for each project, to further aid decision-making for project promotion and selection."

Customers made a total of 15 transactions in March 2018, with a total transaction amount of $19,624.40.\n4. The transactions consist of payments and refunds for both credit and debit card types.\n5. The transactions appear to be evenly distributed between credit and debit cards. Credit cards had a total transaction amount of $3,496.89 for payments and $5,282.14 for refunds, while debit cards had a total transaction amount of $5,150.41 for payments and $5,694.96 for refunds.\n6. Some customers have more transactions than others, with customer 4 having the highest number of transactions (a total of 3 transactions with both payments and refunds included).\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Investigate further the high number of refunds, especially for credit cards, to ensure there is no fraudulent activity or issues with the transactions.\n2. Examine the transactions for specific customers with a higher number of transactions, such as customer 4, to identify any potential issues related to their account or transactions.\n3. Monitor the transaction amount trends over a longer period to better understand patterns and customer behavior. If necessary, take appropriate actions to resolve any issues identified during this analysis.\n4. Explore potential measures to increase payment transactions, such as marketing campaigns or promotional offers, in order to boost revenue.\n5. Engage with customers who have fewer or no transactions in the given period to understand their needs and preferences. Implement appropriate changes to encourage them to utilize their cards for transactions."

On average, payments are $221.54 more than refunds.\n3. There is a wide range of transaction amounts for customers, which indicates differing customer spending profiles. Some customers have a transaction range of more than $1,000, while others have no range at all.\n4. Regular accounts have a higher median transaction amount than VIP accounts, but VIP accounts have a wider range of transaction amounts, from $357.06 to $1,967.75.\n5. Credit and debit card transactions show similar statistics, with only slight differences in mean and median values. However, credit cards have a slightly higher maximum transaction amount than debit cards.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Monitor the high ratio of refunds to payments, as it may indicate a potential issue with transactions or customer satisfaction.\n2. Investigate the customers with the largest transaction ranges and spending habits to better understand their risk profiles and to potentially tailor products or services for their needs.\n3. Consider offering tailored credit or loan options for customers with a larger transaction range or higher average spending, assuming a positive credit history.\n4. Analyze the reasons for the wide range of transaction amounts for VIP accounts and determine if it's necessary to adjust account benefits or services to better accommodate their spending habits.\n5. Evaluate if additional fraud detection measures are required for higher transaction amounts, especially for credit cards, which have a slightly higher maximum transaction amount than debit cards."

The total transaction volume varies significantly among customers, with the average transaction amount ranging from 357.06 to 1,701.23.\n3. Credit cards are used more for refunds (73% of credit card transactions), while debit cards' usage is balanced between payments and refunds (50% for each type of transaction).\n4. Some customers' cards have expired, with the latest expiry date being in March 2018.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Improve customer satisfaction by offering promotions or loyalty programs that encourage customers to make more transactions (especially for those with low transaction volumes).\n2. Send reminders to customers whose cards are approaching their expiration date or have already expired, and facilitate the process of getting a new card to ensure continuous service.\n3. Investigate the reasons behind the significant use of credit cards for refunds and consider adjusting policies or procedures to avoid high refund rates and improve customer experience.\n4. Conduct surveys or gather customer feedback to better understand the factors influencing their choices between credit and debit cards, as well as their transaction patterns, to develop targeted improvements for each segment."

The average attendance for the orchestras with available data also varies greatly, with 2431 attendees for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and 555 for the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.\n3. The correlation between the year an orchestra was founded and its average performance ratings is weak (0.023), indicating no relationship.\n4. There is a moderately strong negative correlation (-0.837) between the year an orchestra was founded and its average attendance, suggesting that recently founded orchestras on average have higher attendance.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Prioritize curriculum content that focuses on orchestras with higher average ratings, such as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Kirov Orchestra. This will expose students to high-quality performances that could inspire and inform their learning.\n2. Examine and introduce teaching methods or techniques that are frequently used by successful conductors, such as Pierre Boulez and Valeri Gergiev.\n3. Encourage collaborations with newly-established orchestras because they tend to have higher attendance, which could increase the visibility of the music department. Working with more \"modern\" orchestras might help your department stay relevant and innovative.\n4. Since the age of the orchestra seems to have no bearing on performance quality, consider introducing a diverse range of orchestras to the curriculum to expose students to various influences throughout history."

The most popular orchestras based on average official ratings are the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Kirov Orchestra, and Seattle Symphony Orchestra.\n2. Among the analyzed orchestras, attendance tends to be positively correlated with both popularity (ratings) and conductor experience; orchestras with higher ratings and years of experience typically have higher attendance.\n3. Orchestra compositions vary in performance types, with different orchestras having different ratios of auditions, semi-finals, live finals, and other performances.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider inviting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Kirov Orchestra, and Seattle Symphony Orchestra as they have the highest popularity based on official ratings.\n2. Prioritize orchestras with higher attendance and experienced conductors, as they tend to correlate with higher popularity.\n3. Analyze the type of performances that cater to your audience's preferences, and consider selecting orchestras with experience in those types of performances to gain more interest and engagement from the audience."

The median salaries by major are highest for Computer Science ($87,069.50), followed by Cognitive Science ($83,547.00) and ECE ($83,897.50).\n4. The employment rates by major vary significantly, with Cognitive Science and History having 100% employment rates, while Chemical Engineering has a 0% employment rate.\n5. There is a weak positive correlation (0.09) between average salary and employment rate per major.\n6. The average salary and employment rate also vary by city code, with some cities having high salaries and employment rates, while others have low salaries and 0% employment rates.\n7. There is no significant correlation (-0.00) between average salary and employment rate for city codes.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Focus on providing additional support to majors with lower employment rates, such as Chemical Engineering.\n2. Consider researching and sharing more information with students about regional job markets to help them make informed decisions regarding potential employment locations.\n3. Conduct further analysis on factors impacting employment and salary outcomes to better understand which variables contribute to the differences across majors and city codes.\n4. Monitor and track employment data over time to see if trends change or if certain areas need more targeted support from career services.\n5. Organize workshops and events highlighting successful alumni in various majors and regions to inspire current students and provide networking opportunities."

Allocate more financial aid resources to students with higher financial need scores, prioritizing the top 10 students from the output.\n2. You may want to consider additional factors, such as family income or economic background, to fine-tune the financial need score calculations.\n3. Continuously update the city cost of living index to better estimate the financial needs of students from different cities.\n4. Consider conducting surveys or gathering more detailed information on the students to have a better understanding of their financial situations and needs."

The majority of students are enrolled in the Computer Science major, with 18 students, followed by ECE (6 students), Mathematical Sciences (5 students), Chemical Engineering (2 students), Cognitive Science (2 students), and History (1 student).\n3. On average, students are enrolled in approximately 6 courses, with some students taking up to 8 courses.\n4. The distribution of grades varies across age groups and majors, possibly reflecting varying levels of academic performance and course difficulty.\n5. Most courses are offered within the Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences departments, and these same departments have higher numbers of faculty members.\n6. The students' geographical distribution based on city codes is quite diverse, indicating a broad range of backgrounds among the student population.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Given that the Computer Science major has the highest number of students and the most courses offered, consider allocating additional resources such as course sections or hiring more faculty to meet the needs of the student population in this field.\n2. Investigate further into the differences in grade distributions across age groups and majors. If specific factors, such as course difficulty or teaching quality, are identified, address those issues accordingly.\n3. Regularly evaluate course scheduling and availability based on existing enrollment patterns, optimizing for the current distribution of majors among students.\n4.

Female student-athletes have a slightly lower mean GPA of 3.15 compared to male student-athletes with a mean GPA of 3.29.\n3. The Department of ECE (Electrical and Computer Engineering) has the highest mean GPA (3.41) among the majors, while the Cognitive Science department has the lowest mean GPA (2.98) among the available data.\n4. Older student-athletes aged 22 have the highest mean GPA (3.67), followed by the youngest age group (16 years) with a mean GPA of 3.6.\n5. The GPA has moderate fluctuations across different majors.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Monitor the academic performance of student-athletes more closely, especially those in the Cognitive Science department, to identify any support or resources that may be required for their improvement.\n2. Investigate the factors that have contributed to higher GPAs in certain majors, such as the Department of ECE, and consider adopting similar strategies across other departments to improve overall academic performance.\n3. Assess the athletic commitments of student-athletes with lower GPAs to discern if there is a need to adjust their practice schedules or provide additional academic support resources, such as tutoring, to help balance their academic and athletic pursuits.\n4. Since age seems to have a positive correlation with GPA to a certain extent, tailor academic support programs to cater to the specific needs of younger student-athletes, who may be navigating both their academic and athletic development.\n5. Regularly track and analyze GPA data to evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions or support programs implemented for student-athletes and make adjustments accordingly."

The average age of students is similar across all majors, ranging from 17.5 in Chemical Engineering to 22 in Cognitive Science.\n3. The college offers a wide range of courses with varying credits, with the majority of them (59) being 3-credit courses.\n4. The courses are mostly concentrated in Computer Science (26 courses), Mathematical Sciences (21 courses), and ECE (19 courses).\n5. Instructors teach different numbers of courses, with some faculty members teaching multiple courses while others teach only one.\n6. The average grade for each course varies, with some courses having higher average grades and others with lower averages.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. Consider allocating funds to support underrepresented or smaller majors, such as History or Chemical Engineering, to encourage more students to join these programs.\n2. Look into the courses with lower average grades or a significantly varied grade distribution, and allocate funds to improve teaching resources or hire additional faculty members in those areas.\n3. Improve the college's overall offering of courses by supporting the growth of established programs (like Computer Science) as well as expanding lesser-offered departments.\n4. Allocate funds for faculty development and training, ensuring continued excellence in teaching and research across all departments.\n5. Support initiatives to improve and diversify the college's course offerings in terms of credits, subject areas, and instruction styles.\n6. Encourage interdepartmental collaboration and interdisciplinary learning opportunities by funding joint projects, courses, or research initiatives between various departments."

Reassign courses to balance teacher workload: Assign courses to Joseph Huts and John Deloor and reduce workload for Anne Walker.\n2. Monitor unassigned courses: Investigate why Geography, Sports, French, Health, and Music courses are not assigned to any teachers and take necessary actions, if required.\n3. Evaluate course content and teaching methods: Investigate the reason behind the difference in performance (grades) between courses and address the issues to improve overall course quality.\n4. Investigate the impact of starting days on course performance: Consider adjusting starting days based on the analysis that courses that start on Wednesday have the highest average grade. But also gather more data for better conclusions.\n5. No significant relationship between teacher's age and course performance: Age is not a strong factor affecting course performance, so focus more on teaching skills and experience while assigning courses."

The most popular course is History, with 7 students enrolled, and the least popular courses are Math and Bible, with only 1 student enrolled each.\n3. There are 5 different teachers in the dataset, teaching a total of 6 courses.\n4. The average age of the teachers is 36.8 years, with the youngest teacher (Vicente Carretero) being 26 years old and the oldest teacher (Kearsley Brown) being 45 years old.\n5. Courses start between May 6th and May 17th. The earliest starting course is Math, and the latest starting course is Music.\n6. History, Science, and Music have the highest enrollment numbers, while Math and Bible have the lowest enrollment numbers.\n\n### Suggestions\n1. As a school counselor, you may want to investigate the reasons for the low enrollment in Math and Bible courses and consider offering additional resources or support to encourage more students to enroll in these subjects.\n2. It might be helpful to collect feedback from students and teachers about the courses and use that information to improve course design or instructional strategies.\n3. Consider collaborating with teachers of popular courses to share best practices with other teachers, as this might help improve engagement and enrollment in less popular courses.\n4. Analyze course offerings and enrollment data on a regular basis, making data-informed decisions about which courses to continue, expand or remove.\n5. When planning for college and career guidance, you may want to focus on the most popular courses that have the highest enrollment numbers, or explore why certain courses are more popular than others.\n6. In the future, it would be helpful to also have data on student demographics, attendance, and performance, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the school's course offerings and how they can be tailored to the needs of the students."
